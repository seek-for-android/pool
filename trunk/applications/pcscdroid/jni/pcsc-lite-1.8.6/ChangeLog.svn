	* [r6451] Makefile.am, configure.in, m4/acx_pthread.m4,
	  m4/ax_pthread.m4: USe ax_pthread.m4 instead of acx_pthread.m4
	  
	  Fix "autoreconf -vis -Wall" warnings: configure.in:75: warning:

	* [r6447] src/readerfactory.c: RFCreateReaderHandle(): fix compiler
	  warning
	  
	  readerfactory.c: In function ‘RFCreateReaderHandle’:
	  readerfactory.c:1054: warning: unused parameter ‘rContext’
	  
	  Maybe the rContext will be used one day.
	* [r6446] src/pcscdaemon.c: Fix redirection of stdin, stdout and
	  stderr to /dev/null
	  
	  The file descriptors for stdin, stdout and stderr were closed so
	  any library (like libusb) sending debug log to stderr was
	  confusing pcscd since file descriptor 2 (ex stderr) was re-used
	  for something else.
	  
	  Now the file descriptor 3 is really redirected to /dev/null
	* [r6445] src/debuglog.c: Increase DEBUG_BUF_SIZE to avoid log
	  lines truncations
	  
	  Increase the value from 160 to 2048. Some "long" log lines where
	  truncated.
	  
	  Example: Aug 24 10:22:39 neo pcscd:
	  readerfactory.c:978:RFInitializeReader() Attempting startup of
	  Gemalto PC Twin Reader (70D7E2EE) 00 00 using
	  /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Lin
	* [r6444] src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: Remove useless parenthesis
	  
	  Replace the constructions &(structure->field) by
	  &structure->field since that is equivalent.
	* [r6443] src/winscard_svc.c: MSGAddHandle(): Add mutex lock/unlock
	  around cardsList list
	  
	  A lock/unlock pair of mutex was missing.
	  
	  Thanks to Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@vmware.com> for the patch
	* [r6442] src/winscard_svc.c: CreateContextThread(): Use only one
	  lock/unlock pair
	  
	  It is quite often useless to lock a resource, perform
	  calculation, unlock the resource and then act conditionally upon
	  the result of the calculation, because as soon as shared resource
	  is unlocked the condition may change and the previous calculation
	  will become obsolete.
	  
	  Signed-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@vmware.com>
	* [r6441] src/winscard_msg.c: ClientSetupSession(): use fcntl() to
	  make the socket non blocking
	  
	  ioctl(fd, FIONBIO. ...) is not the standard way of marking
	  sockets and other objects nonblocking, fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags |
	  O_NONBLOCK) is.

2012-08-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6440] Makefile.am, configure.in, m4/Makefile.am: Integrate
	  m4/Makefile.am into Makefile.am
	  
	  The idea is to remove a Makefile files to speed up compilation.
	  
	  Thanks to Diego Elio Pettenò for the idea.
	* [r6439] Makefile.am: Reformat

2012-08-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6434] src/spy/pcsc-spy.pod: opensc-tool is not a good example
	  
	  opensc-tool is no more linked to libpcsclite.so.1. Use pcsc_scan
	  as an example instead.

2012-08-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6430] doc/update.sh: Script to uppload the Doxygen doc on the
	  web server

2012-08-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6419] src/spy/Makefile.am: Add -I$(top_builddir)/src/PCSC to
	  find the generated pcsclite.h
	  
	  Thanks to Dmitry Torokhov for the bug report and patch.
	* [r6414] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen: fix warning: missing title
	  after \defgroup API
	* [r6413] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: Doxygen: fix warning: missing
	  title after \defgroup IFDHandler
	* [r6412] doc/doxygen.conf.in: Make doxygen quiet to only have
	  warnings and errors

2012-08-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6402] src/pcscdaemon.c: Exit if no hotplug (USB) drivers are
	  found _and_ serial drivers are not in use
	  
	  If only a serial driver is used and not drivers are present in
	  PCSCLITE_HP_DROPDIR then pcscd exited after logging:
	  hotplug_libudev.c:96:HPReadBundleValues() Cannot open PC/SC
	  drivers directory: /usr/lib64/readers/usb
	  
	  pcscd will now exit only if USE_SERIAL is not defined.
	  
	  Thanks to Oliver Schinagl for the bug report.

2012-08-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6401] ChangeLog, configure.in: Release 1.8.5
	* [r6400] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen: Fix dwControlCode code
	  
	  Thanks to Marcin Cieslak for the bug report

2012-08-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6397] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: Merge
	  RFReaderInfoNamePort() into RFRemoveReader() since that is the
	  only user. Also improve RFRemoveReader() to remove all the slots
	  of a reader.
	  
	  Closes [#313708] Multi-slot support is broken

2012-07-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6391] src/eventhandler.c, src/winscard.c: Fix typo in log
	  message

2012-07-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6389] src/readerfactory.h: REF_READER/UNREF_READER: Change log
	  level from CRITICAL to DEBUG
	  
	  No need to use the PCSC_LOG_CRITICAL level on a production
	  system.
	* [r6388] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h, src/winscard.c:
	  Add a reader reference count to be used as a Garbage Collector
	  
	  A reader should be removed only when no one is using it, not just
	  when the reader is unplugged.
	  
	  An application may be in the middle of using the reader when the
	  reader is unplugged. If the reader is removed right when
	  unplugged then pcscd may use a no more existing reader structure
	  and crash.
	  
	  Thanks to Martin Vogt for the bug report.

2012-07-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6386] src/readerfactory.c: RFRemoveReader(): only remove one
	  reader
	  
	  We should not need to loop over every matching reader and remove
	  them all. Or I am missing something.
	  
	  This code is present since the first version of RFRemoveReader()
	  back in 2002.

2012-07-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6385] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardBeginTransaction(): remove an
	  extra line
	  
	  The loop could be an infinite loop in case rv ==
	  SCARD_E_SHARING_VIOLATION but we get out of the for (;;) loop
	  exactly when rv != SCARD_E_SHARING_VIOLATION
	  
	  The bug was introduced in revision 6358.
	* [r6384] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): fix a off-by-one bug
	  
	  strlen() returnd the number of characters without the final NUL
	  byte.
	  
	  The bugs was introduced in revision 6354.
	* [r6383] src/pcscdaemon.c: Fix a TOCTOU problem
	  
	  Do not check for PCSCLITE_IPC_DIR presence before creating it.
	  Just create it and manage the case it already existed.
	  
	  Coverity: Time of check time of use (TOCTOU)
	* [r6382] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: spy_line(): move the call to
	  va_end(args); earlier
	  
	  In case the buffer is too small we exit the function without
	  calling va_end().
	  
	  Coverity: Missing varargs init or cleanup (VARARGS)

2012-06-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6380] src/hotplug_libudev.c: HPAddDevice(): check
	  udev_device_get_sysattr_value() is not NULL
	  
	  The value returned by udev_device_get_sysattr_value(dev,
	  "bInterfaceNumber") may be NULL (maybe the reader has been
	  removed just after been inserted). And atoi() do not like to work
	  on NULL.
	* [r6379] src/readerfactory.h: Fix comment
	* [r6378] src/winscard.c: SCardTransmit(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return rv;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6377] src/winscard.c: SCardSetAttrib(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return rv;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6376] src/winscard.c: SCardGetAttrib(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return.
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6375] src/winscard.c: SCardControl(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return.
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6374] src/winscard.c: SCardStatus(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return rv;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6373] src/winscard.c: SCardEndTransaction(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return rv;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6372] src/winscard.c: SCardBeginTransaction(): use an exit
	  block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return SCARD_E_*;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6371] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return SCARD_E_*;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6370] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): code reformat
	* [r6369] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): use an exit block
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return SCARD_E_*;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6368] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): use an exit bloc
	  
	  goto exit; instead of a direct return SCARD_E_*;
	  
	  This will allow to factorize exit code.
	* [r6367] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): check the parameters
	  before anything
	  
	  Do not lose time finding the rContext if the dwDisposition
	  parameter is wrong. Exit early.

2012-06-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6366] doc/doxygen.conf.in: Update to Doxygen 1.8.1.1
	* [r6364] ChangeLog, configure.in: Release 1.8.4
	* [r6363] UnitaryTests/SCardBeginTransaction_deadlock.py: Unitary
	  test for locking in SCardBeginTransaction, SCardTransmit,
	  SCardStatus and SCardReconnect
	* [r6362] src/winscard_clnt.c: With changes in revisions 6358 to
	  6361 it is now possible to use the same SCARDCONTEXT in different
	  threads (same as on Windows)
	  
	  With one context per thread the locking was controlled by the
	  daemon. With the same context for 2 threads the locking is
	  controlled (first) on the client side since the 2 threads uses
	  the same mutex.
	* [r6361] src/winscard_clnt.c: Similar patch as in revision 6358
	  but for SCardReconnect()
	  
	  Thanks to Aleksey Samsonov for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2012-q2/0109.html
	* [r6360] src/winscard_clnt.c: Similar patch as in revision 6358
	  but for SCardBeginTransaction()
	  
	  Thanks to Aleksey Samsonov for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2012-q2/0109.html
	* [r6359] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardStatus(): Similar patch as in
	  revision 6358 but for SCardStatus()
	  
	  Thanks to Aleksey Samsonov for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2012-q2/0109.html
	* [r6358] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardTransmit(): do not hold the
	  mutex when waiting in a SCARD_E_SHARING_VIOLATION loop
	  
	  If SCardTransmit() is waiting because the reader is used by
	  another thread/process then we release the
	  currentContextMap->mMutex, sleep, and try to acquire the mutex
	  again. This will allow another thread using the same hContext to
	  call SCardEndTransaction() otherwise the mutex is already held by
	  SCardTransmit() and SCardEndTransaction() can't get it to finish
	  the transaction => dead lock
	  
	  Thanks to Aleksey Samsonov for the patch

2012-06-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6357] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: Update Doxygen: document
	  "libusb-1.0" scheme
	  
	  the "libusb" (for libusb-0.1) scheme has been updated to a
	  "libusb-1.0" scheme (for libusb-1.0). The device name now
	  contains the interface number. The bus and device are now
	  integers instead of paths.
	  
	  The change has been done in revision 5044 (June 2010) but the API
	  was not updated at the same time.
	* [r6356] src/readerfactory.c: RFReaderInfoNamePort(): Compare only
	  the significant part of the reader name
	  
	  Since revision 6354 the reader name may be truncated. Only the
	  part in readerState->readerName (managed by RFAddReader()) is
	  truntacted. The reader name stored the hotplug_*.c
	  readerTracker[] structures is NOT truncated. So we must use a
	  truncated compare function to find the reader name.
	* [r6355] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: Increase MAX_READERNAME from 100
	  to 128
	  
	  It is not a perfect solution but it should limit the truncations
	  of reader names as introduced in revision 6354.
	* [r6354] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): truncates the reader
	  name if too long
	  
	  The reader name size is limited to a total of MAX_READERNAME
	  characters (100 by default). But some reader names are very long
	  like: "SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR3340 - ExpressCard54 Smart Card
	  Reader" and also provide a serial number and an interface name.
	  So the name constructed by hotplug_libudev.c can be very long and
	  longer than the 100 caracters.
	  
	  Closes: [#313684] "Reader name too long" error
	  https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=410085&aid=313684&group_id=30105

	* [r6353] src/hotplug_libudev.c: HPRescanUsbBus(): Display the full
	  name of the removed reader

2012-06-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6325] src/tokenparser.l: Add [ and ] in the list of accepted
	  characters for a reader name
	  
	  Readers with these characters caused a crash in libccid without
	  any error message. This is because the reader entry was skiped
	  and a reader name was then missing in the list. NULL is not a
	  valid reader name :-)
	  
	  Thanks to Philippe Teuwen for the bug report.

2012-06-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6323] src/pcscd.h.in: Remove now useless PCSCLITE_SVC_IDENTITY
	  
	  PCSCLITE_SVC_IDENTITY is no more used since revision 6322.
	* [r6322] src/winscard.c: SCardEstablishContext(): Use a full
	  32-bits random value
	  
	  Use a full int range (32-bits) value instead of a 16-bits value.
	  
	  Note: this value is (still) not used/checked on the server side.
	* [r6321] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: remove
	  dwIdentity field from ReaderContext structure
	  
	  Since revision 6320 dwIdentity is no more used. So we can remove
	  it.
	* [r6320] src/readerfactory.c: RFCreateReaderHandle(): generates a
	  32-bits random for hCard
	  
	  Since the change in revision 6316 dwIdentity is no more used to
	  identify a hCard -> reader relation. So we can just generate a
	  hCard as a full 32-bits random.
	  
	  The security should be improved with a change from 16-bits random
	  to a 32-bits random. It will be more difficult for a rogue client
	  to guess a valid hCard value.
	* [r6319] src/sys_unix.c: SYS_RandomInt(): extend range if fEnd ==
	  -1
	  
	  If fEnd parameter is set to -1 then the result of rand() is not
	  truncated. This is usefull to get 32-bits of random with no
	  constraint on the values.
	* [r6318] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: Remove now
	  unused function RFFindReaderHandle()
	  
	  Since revision 6317 this function is no more used.
	* [r6317] src/winscard.c: Calls to RFFindReaderHandle() are now
	  useless
	  
	  RFFindReaderHandle() was used to check the hCard is valid. Since
	  revision 6316 the algorithm used in RFFindReaderHandle() is
	  already used in RFReaderInfoById().
	  
	  So calling RFFindReaderHandle() after RFReaderInfoById() (as it
	  was done) is now useless.
	* [r6316] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: Use handlesList
	  to find a hCard -> reader link
	  
	  hCard handles are stored in the handlesList list of readers. The
	  use of dwIdentity just duplicate the information and is no more
	  needed.
	  
	  The algorithm is the same as in RFFindReaderHandle()

	  From /System/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/Headers/winscard.h
	  /* To support the newer version of SCardControl, we define it as
	  follows. The old version number was 1.1.2, the new call appears
	  in 1.3.2 of pcsc-lite (or perhaps earlier). */

	* [r6199] src/spy/Makefile.am: Generate a Mac OS X PCSC.framework
	  hierarchy
	  
	  Mac OS X uses a framework and not just a library. The hiearchy is
	  simple: PCSC.framework PCSC.framework/PCSC ->
	  Versions/Current/PCS PCSC.framework/Versions
	  PCSC.framework/Versions/A PCSC.framework/Versions/A/PCSC
	  PCSC.framework/Versions/Current -> A
	* [r6198] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: Add Mac OS X support
	* [r6197] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: Use ULONG * instead of unsigned
	  long *
	  
	  See comment in revision 6195
	* [r6196] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: Reformat
	* [r6195] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: Use LONG/ULONG instead of
	  long/unsigned long
	  
	  The problem is that PCSC on Mac OS X do not use long but
	  uint32_t. So a (LONG * or LPDWORD *) parameter (like pcchReaders
	  in SCardListReaders) is not the same on Linux and Mac OS X for
	  64-bits CPUs.
	  
	  LONG is correctly defined on both Linux and Mac OS X so we use it
	  instead.
	* [r6194] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: load_lib(): check dlsym() return
	  correct values
	  
	  If the pointer returned by dlsym("SCardEstablishContext") is our
	  own SCardEstablishContext() function then we will finish in a
	  endless recursion. Something went wrong and we stop immediatly
	  instead of crashing when the call stack is full.
	* [r6193] src/spy/libpcscspy.c: Use an internal
	  pcsc_stringify_error() by default
	  
	  If the loading of the PCSC library fails all the functions are
	  set to use internal_error(). The only expection is now
	  pcsc_stringify_error() because the return value is not a LONG
	  error code but a C-string.
	  
	  This change fixes a crash when the application called printf() to
	  display the "string" returned by pcsc_stringify_error() if
	  SCardEstablishContext() failed in the spying library.

2012-01-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6185] ChangeLog, configure.in: Release 1.8.2
	* [r6184] src/spy/pcsc-spy, src/spy/pcsc-spy.pod: Add support of
	  --version to pcsc-spy
	* [r6183] src/spy/Makefile.am, src/spy/pcsc-spy.1,
	  src/spy/pcsc-spy.pod: Use POD format for pcsc-spy manpage
	  
	  Writting nroff manpage directly is not easy. The Perl POD (plain
	  old documentation) is much more friendly to read/write and
	  pod2man is your friend.
	* [r6182] src/spy/pcsc-spy: print_usage(): display command name
	* [r6181] src/spy/pcsc-spy: Document [-h|--help] argument

2012-01-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6178] src/spy/Makefile.am: Use dist_man_MANS to distribute the
	  manpage
	  
	  The pcsc-spy.1 manpage is now included in the .tar.bz2 archive
	* [r6177] src/spy/Makefile.am, src/spy/libpcscspy.c,
	  src/spy/pcsc-spy.c: Rename pcsc-spy.c to libpcscspy.c
	  
	  We have a pcsc-spy Python binary so pcsc-spy.c is not a correct
	  filename for a different library. Make is trying to generate
	  pcsc-spy from pcsc-spy.c and that fails.
	* [r6176] src/spy/Makefile.am: Remove pcsc-spy.py from EXTRA_DIST
	  
	  The command is now named pcsc-spy and is distributed by default
	* [r6175] src/spy/Makefile.am, src/spy/README.txt,
	  src/spy/pcsc-spy.1: Convert README.txt into pcsc-spy.1
	  
	  Since we now provide the pcsc-spy binary we must also provide a
	  manpage for the command.
	* [r6174] src/spy/pcsc-spy: Update copyright date
	* [r6173] src/spy/pcsc-spy: Change Shebang to /usr/bin/python
	  
	  Comply with Debian Python Policy 3.1 Programs using the default
	  python
	  http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/ch-programs.html
	* [r6172] src/spy/Makefile.am: Install pcsc-spy as a normal binary
	  
	  By default the command is installed in $(prefix)/bin/pcsc-spy
	* [r6171] src/spy/pcsc-spy, src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Rename the
	  pcsc-spy command without the .py extension
	  
	  Comply to Debian Policy 10.4 Scripts
	  http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html#s-scripts

2012-01-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6156] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: Add Doxygen documentation for
	  TAG_IFD_SLOTNUM, TAG_IFD_STOP_POLLING_THREAD and
	  TAG_IFD_POLLING_THREAD_WITH_TIMEOUT

2011-12-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6139] src/spy/pcsc-spy.c: spy_line(): use return instead of
	  exit().
	  
	  A library should not use exit() but return an error code instead.
	  Reported by Debian lintian.

2011-12-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6132] src/tokenparser.l: bundleRelease(): fix a memory leak
	  
	  We must also free the key of the element.
	* [r6131] src/tokenparser.l: eval_value(): avoid a buffer read
	  overflow in &amp; management
	  
	  We shall stop the loop when we find a \0 in the source, not in
	  the destination (4 characters later)
	* [r6130] src/hotplug_libudev.c: HPReadBundleValues(): remove extra
	  free()
	  
	  Do not free memory allocated for CFBundleName since we use this
	  value directly in driverTracker[listCount].CFBundleName =
	  CFBundleName; (line 180) instead of using a strdup(), because the
	  string is the same for many entries
	* [r6129] src/readerfactory.c: RFRemoveReader(): add 2 missing
	  pthread_mutex_destroy()
	  
	  Mutexes for powerState_lock and handlesList_lock were never
	  destroyed.
	  
	  It was not a real problem since from manpage
	  pthread_mutex_destroy(3): In the LinuxThreads implementation, no
	  resources are associated with mutex objects, thus
	  pthread_mutex_destroy actually does nothing except checking that
	  the mutex is unlocked.
	* [r6128] src/readerfactory.c: RFRemoveReader(): fix a bug with a
	  multi-slot reader
	  
	  The value sContext->mMutex must be reset to NULL only for the
	  last slot.

2011-11-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6120] etc/pcscd.service.in: StandardOutput=syslog is now the
	  default since at least systemd 37

2011-11-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6118] ChangeLog, configure.in: Release 1.8.1

2011-11-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6109] UnitaryTests/FEATURE_CCID_ESC_COMMAND2.py: Proprietary
	  commands for Gemalto readers This is implemented by the Gemalto
	  Pinpad v2 and C200 readers
	* [r6108] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Terminate the process with Ctrl-C
	  
	  Thanks to Martin Paljak for the patch
	* [r6107] src/spy/README.txt: Typo

2011-11-14  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6105] configure.in, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard_clnt.c:
	  Remove pcscd autostart feature
	  
	  The auto start feature (launch pcscd from the library if not
	  already running) was a fragile code with some issues. This
	  service is far better implemented by systemd.
	  
	  Thanks to Kalev Lember for pushing the systemd patches.

2011-11-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6104] src/winscard_clnt.c: Do not try to autostart if the
	  system was booted using systemd
	  
	  The --disable-autostart configure option should now be useless on
	  systems using systemd.

2011-11-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6102] src/pcscdaemon.c: Revert revision 6045
	  
	  We must fork+exit in autoexit and foreground mode or the
	  application will not continue its execution and will wait for the
	  end of pcscd

2011-10-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6095] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Add support of -d|--diffable to
	  generate logs without too much variable parts so 2 logs can be
	  compared using diff(1)
	  
	  Variable parts are replaced by "????". They are: - execution time
	  - hCard - hContext
	* [r6094] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Fix cut-n-paste error
	* [r6093] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Add support of --nocolor command
	  line argument
	* [r6092] src/spy/install_spy.sh: Make the script idempotent
	  
	  The symbolic links are repared if needed. They were broken after
	  the sequence: $ spy/install_spy.sh $ make install
	* [r6091] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Exit in exception if the application
	  exited in the middle of SCardGetStatusChange() like it is the
	  case for pcsc_scan

2011-10-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6090] src/tokenparser.l: Convert the firt &amp; into & in a
	  
	  Allow to use names like Giesecke &amp; Devrient
	* [r6089] src/tokenparser.l: Add ';' in the list of valid caracters
	  
	  Allow to use "&amp;" for "&" like in "Giesecke &amp; Devrient"
	  See revision 6088

2011-10-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6083] UnitaryTests/ThreadSafe.py: Start loops at 0 instead of 1
	  to have the correct count
	* [r6082] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Give statistics per thread
	* [r6081] .gitignore: Update for spy/ directory
	* [r6080] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Use a 4 spaces indentation for each
	  thread
	* [r6079] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Display statistics sorted by
	  total_time

2011-10-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6078] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Parse FEATURE_VERIFY_PIN_DIRECT
	  structure
	* [r6077] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: The byte buffer do not contain the
	  ASCII dump any more. So no need to remove it.
	* [r6076] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Parse FEATURE_IFD_PIN_PROPERTIES
	* [r6073] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Remove debug line
	* [r6072] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): do not fail if pcscd.comm is
	  already present but pcscd.pid is not present.
	  
	  This is the case if pcscd has been configured in systemd but has
	  been stoped. When launched by hand (for a debug session for
	  example) the pcscd.comm file is still present but not used
	  anymore.
	  
	  The pcscd.comm file will be removed when pcscd manually started
	  will exit but the file will be recreated by "systemctl start
	  pcscd.service"
	* [r6071] src/pcscd.h.in: Update copyright date
	* [r6070] src/pcscd.h.in: propset svn:keywords "Id"
	* [r6069] src/pcscd.h.in: MAX_BUFFER_SIZE and
	  MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_EXTENDED are already defined in
	  PCSC/pcsclite.h.in

2011-10-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6063] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: Update MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_EXTENDED
	  by adding 2 bytes for the status word
	* [r6062] etc/pcscd.service.in: Remove WantedBy=multi-user.target
	  
	  The purpose of using systemd is to start pcscd on demand. So no
	  need to always start it at boot.
	* [r6061] etc/pcscd.service.in: Start pcscd in autoexit mode to: -
	  free RAM and CPU ressources - enable the USB selective suspend
	  http://ludovicrousseau.blogspot.com/2011/04/libccid-and-usb-selective-suspend.html
	* [r6060] etc/pcscd.service.in: Remove now useless
	  After=syslog.target line for recent systemd

2011-10-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	  to 1.6

2011-10-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6056] src/winscard_clnt.c: Remove DO_CHECK_SAME_PROCESS code
	  since we now use pthread_atfork() since revision 6055
	* [r6055] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContext(): Invalidate
	  all the handles in the son after a fork
	  
	  The Unitary Test UnitaryTests/SCard_fork.py now works
	  
	  We now use pthread_atfork() instead of the DO_CHECK_SAME_PROCESS
	  hack (disabled by default)
	* [r6054] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: log_out_n_str(): add special case
	  for a null string length
	* [r6053] src/spy/README.txt: Documentation file
	* [r6052] src/spy/pcsc-spy.c, src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Add support of
	  SCardCancel() and multi-threaded applications
	  
	  The pcsc-spy.py client is now a demultiplexer with one thread and
	  data queue per applicatin thread. Each log line contains the
	  application threadID.
	* [r6051] src/spy/install_spy.sh, src/spy/uninstall_spy.sh: Use set
	  -e to exit on first error
	* [r6050] src/spy/install_spy.sh: Fail if libpcsclite_nospy.so.1
	  already exists

2011-10-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6045] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): do not fork+exit if we are in
	  autoexit mode and also in foreground mode
	* [r6044] src/pcscdaemon.c: signal_trap(): if we exit after a
	  SIGALRM then exit with EXIT_SUCCESS
	  
	  systemd should be happier with a process exiting normally
	* [r6043] src/winscard_msg_srv.c: InitializeSocket(): use a union
	  for sockaddr structsas suggested by systemd sample code at
	  http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html
	* [r6042] src/spy/pcsc-spy.c: Use a global symbol for the library
	  handle
	  
	  Make coverity more happy leaked_storage: Variable "handle" going
	  out of scope leaks the storage it points to. noescape: Variable
	  "handle" is not freed or pointed-to in function "dlsym".

2011-10-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6029] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): do not fork+exit if started in
	  --auto-exit mode by systemd
	  
	  systemd should restart the daemon again if needed
	* [r6028] src/debuglog.c: log_line(): flush stdout after each line
	  so that debug messages are immediately available for systemd
	* [r6027] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): store the pid _after_ any fork
	  
	  Revision 6019 moved the AutoExit fork+exit later in the code. We
	  now must move the pcscd.pid file creation after the fork+exit.
	* [r6026] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): log a message when pcscd is
	  started by systemd

2011-10-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r6019] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): move AutoExit fork+exit later
	  in the code
	  
	  We should be able to return with an error code if something went
	  wrong in the pcscd initialization so that the client get the
	  error code and do not wait for 5 seconds.
	  
	  See Red Hat Bug 653903 - elinks takes 10 seconds to start
	* [r6018] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContext(): check the
	  return value of pcscd
	  
	  In auto-start mode the client check the value returned by pcscd.
	  If pcscd failed to start then we just return SCARD_E_NO_SERVICE
	  without waiting for 5 seconds.
	  
	  See Red Hat Bug 653903 - elinks takes 10 seconds to start
	* [r6017] src/pcscdaemon.c: print_usage(): reformat output

	* [r6015] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: log_buffer(): display NULL if the
	  buffer is a NULL pointer
	  
	  This is used to differentiate a NULL buffer from an empty buffer.
	* [r6014] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: log_buffer(): use upper case for
	  hexadecimal dump
	* [r6013] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: log_buffer(): use '.' also for
	  values >= 127
	* [r6012] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: log_buffer(): check for an empty
	  buffer
	* [r6011] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: If the field to log starts with a
	  "0x" we also log the decimal value
	* [r6010] src/spy/pcsc-spy.c: spy_buffer(): use spy_line_direct()
	  to log a line without formatting and size limit
	* [r6009] src/spy/pcsc-spy.c: spy_line(): Emergency exit if the
	  buffer is too small
	  
	  The line is limited to 256 characters. Dumping a buffer of more
	  than 256/3 = 85 bytes wil overflow the line buffer.
	* [r6008] src/spy/install_spy.sh, src/spy/pcsc-spy.c,
	  src/spy/uninstall_spy.sh: Allow to replace the real library by
	  the spy one
	  
	  This is isefull for interpreted languages like Python and Perl
	  with the PC/SC wrapper.
	  
	  The scripts install_spy.sh and uninstall_spy.sh do the files
	  changes in /usr/lib
	* [r6007] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Remove trailing space
	* [r6006] src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Use a text instead of numerical
	  constant to specify the direction
	* [r6005] src/spy/pcsc-spy.c, src/spy/pcsc-spy.py: Dump bytes
	  buffer in a formatted ASCII + Hex dump

	  This is used for SCardListReaders() and SCardListReaderGroups()
	* [r5942] src/pcsc-spy.c: load_lib(): Do not use an absolut
	  pathname
	  
	  Use "libpcsclite.so.1" instead of "/usr/lib/libpcsclite.so.1" to

	  On Ubuntu 10.04: $ pkg-config --libs libudev -ludev $ dpkg -l
	  libudev-dev ii libudev-dev 151-12.3 udev library (development
	  files)
	  
	  On Debian wheery: $ pkg-config --libs libudev -ludev -lrt $ dpkg

	  The correct option is --auto-exit
	* [r5936] .gitignore: Add new files to .gitignore
	* [r5935] etc/pcscd.service.in: Use long arguments to pcscd command
	  
	  --foreground and --hotplug are easier to understand than -f and
	  -H
	* [r5934] configure.in: Add --with-systemdsystemunitdir=DIR comment
	* [r5933] Makefile.am, configure.in, etc, etc/Makefile.am,
	  etc/pcscd.service.in, etc/pcscd.socket.in: Install systemd
	  service files
	  
	  Thanks to Kalev Lember for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2011-q2/0139.html
	* [r5932] src/winscard_clnt.c: Fix compiler warning when autostart
	  is not used
	  
	  winscard_clnt.c: In function `SCardEstablishContext':
	  winscard_clnt.c:455:1: warning: label `again' defined but not
	  used [-Wunused-label]
	* [r5931] configure.in, src/winscard_clnt.c: Add
	  --disable-autostart option
	  
	  This option disables pcscd autostarting code in the libpcsclite
	  library.
	  
	  With systemd socket activation in place, pcscd can be started
	  automatically by systemd when a request arrives on the IPC
	  socket. That makes starting the service as a fork from user
	  library unnecessary.
	  
	  Thanks to Kalev Lember for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2011-q2/0137.html
	* [r5930] src/Makefile.am: Use curl -O instead of a redirection
	  
	  This avoids a name duplication (less error-prone)
	* [r5929] src/Makefile.am, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/sd-daemon.c,
	  src/sd-daemon.h, src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_msg_srv.c:
	  Support systemd socket activation
	  
	  Add systemd socket-based activation support to pcscd as an
	  alternative to the existing autostart code which used forking
	  from the user space library. Systemd socket activation makes it
	  possible to start pcscd on demand by systemd when a request is
	  sent on the IPC socket.
	  
	  The implementation uses the $LISTEN_FDS/$LISTEN_PID env var
	  parsing code from systemd's sd-daemon.[ch] copy library.
	  
	  Thanks to Kalev Lember for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2011-q2/0140.html

2011-08-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5901] src/debuglog.c: log_xxd_always(): Use a variable-length
	  array
	  
	  The debug message buffer is no more with a fixed size (around 600
	  bytes of buffer to log) but uses a variable-length array.
	  
	  It is now possible to log extended APDU of 64kB.
	  
	  The variable-length array feature is available in GCC in C90 mode
	  and is mandatory in C99 standard.
	* [r5900] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h:
	  RFSetReaderName(): remove useless parameter slot
	  
	  RFSetReaderName() is only called in one place with slot set to 0.
	  This parameter is then useless and can be removed.
	* [r5899] src/debuglog.c: Use sizeof instead of a hard coded value
	* [r5898] src/debug.c: Remove log_xxd() implementation
	  
	  debug.c is use to log from the client side (libpcsclite).
	  log_xxd() is not used in the client library so is just dead code.
	* [r5896] src/debuglog.c: log_line(): correctly calculate delta
	  time when no color is used
	  
	  The update of last_time was only done in case of colorization
	  (LogDoColor). So on unsupported consoles the time was wrong.

	  Windows XP has this behavior.

	* [r5705] TODO: Fix: "start pcscd only when a reader is connected"

	  reader"
	  
	  Now that pcscd is auto started it will be started only if an
	  appication is using the PC/SC API. This is the case since release
	  1.6.0: - SCardEstablishContext(): try to start the pcscd daemon
	  if not already running. . pcscd will suicide itself after 60
	  seconds of inactivity if it is started using --auto-exit. This is
	  the default behavior when pcscd is started by libpcsclite . Set
	  PCSCLITE_PCSCD_ARGS with the argument you want to pass to pcscd
	  in autostart Only one argument is passed. The space character is
	  not a separator. example: export PCSCLITE_PCSCD_ARGS=-dfa

	  This is the case since release 1.6.0: - Better handling of
	  PCSCLITE_STATIC_DRIVER as can be used on platforms using
	  <B5>Clinux (without dynamic loader). This is used to statically
	  link the reader driver to pcscd. Since the link is static you

	* [r5509]
	  UnitaryTests/SCardGetStatusChange/SCardGetStatusChange_PnP.py:
	  Also initialize the state of the PnP special reader (For Mac OS
	  X)
	* [r5508] src/hotplug_macosx.c: HPSearchHotPluggables(): use the
	  same naming convention as used by Apple PC/SC layer on Leopard
	  (and later). The reader friendly name is used instead of
	  "usb:%04x/%04x" as documented in IFDHandler v3 API at
	  http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/api/group__IFDHandler.html#gabb9fe35a68fa080ce9397f0b830b1e7e
	  
	  The same driver source code can be used by Apple PC/SC layer and
	  by this pcsc-lite.
	* [r5507] src/hotplug_macosx.c: Fix compiler warning
	  
	  hotplug_macosx.c: In function ‘HPDriversGetFromDirectory’:
	  hotplug_macosx.c:150: warning: comparison between signed and

	* [r5506] c.sh: Remove commented CFLAGS definition
	* [r5505] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in, src/PCSC/wintypes.h: Mac OS X
	  "port" - Define Windows types as they are defined on Mac OS X in

	  Pack structures as they are packed on Mac OS X in
	  /System/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/Headers/pcsclite.h
	  
	  With these changes it is possible to build this pcsc-lite on Mac
	  OS X and use it with an application built using the PCSC
	  Framework headers provided by Apple.
	  
	  One application is to temporarily replace the Apple PCSC layer by
	  a better/working one.
	* [r5504] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: Use LONG instead of long for
	  SCARDCONTEXT and SCARDHANDLE so that the exact type can be easily
	  changed by editing PCSC/wintypes.h
	  
	  By default: typedef long LONG; so no change

2011-01-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5501] doc/pcscd.8.in: Remove references to a init.d/pcscd
	  script since pcscd is autostarted by default now.

2011-01-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5496] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): correctly initialize
	  the pthCardEvent field for the other slots. The bug occured with
	  a multi slot reader and a driver with no
	  TAG_IFD_POLLING_THREAD_WITH_TIMEOUT function (as is the case with
	  my CCID driver since revision 5495)

2011-01-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5491] UnitaryTests/SCardConnect_DIRECT2.py: Add comments
	* [r5490] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): Switch to
	  POWER_STATE_GRACE_PERIOD unless the card was not powered
	  
	  In the previous implementation the state was changed to
	  POWER_STATE_GRACE_PERIOD only if the previous state was
	  POWER_STATE_INUSE. So if a SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT connection was used
	  the card state was not set POWER_STATE_INUSE and a power off
	  action was immediate at the SCardDisconnect(). Not nice if the
	  card is reused just after.

2011-01-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5478] src/winscard_svc.c: ContextThread(): in command
	  CMD_GET_READERS_STATE, wait until all the readers are ready (ATR
	  available) before sending the reader states.
	  
	  The problem arrives when you connect two readers at the same time
	  (and one of them is slow to get the ATR). SCardGetStatusChange()
	  must not exit with one reader in state READER_NOT_INITIALIZED (as
	  implemented in revision 5217)

2010-12-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5442] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.6.6
	* [r5441] src/simclist.c: Reapply change in revision 4986 since the
	  problem was not corrected in version 1.5 of simclist.

2010-12-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5440] src/winscard_msg.c: Use LONG instead of int to store
	  PC/SC return codes like SCARD_E_*
	  
	  The problem comes from sign extenstion from int to LONG int rv =
	  SCARD_E_TIMEOUT; /* 0x8010000A */ is (sign) extended into a LONG
	  = 0xFFFFFFFF8010000A
	  
	  So the line in winscard_clnt.c if (SCARD_E_TIMEOUT == rv) is
	  never true on a 64-bits system because rv has been extended from
	  int to LONG. The comparison is then between 0x8010000A and
	  0xFFFFFFFF8010000A

2010-11-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5415] src/eventhandler.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h, src/winscard.c: Add a mutex to make the test
	  and set of the powerState field atomic.

2010-11-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5414] src/eventhandler.c, src/winscard.c: Log the new
	  powerState value at DEBUG level
	* [r5412] src/readerfactory.c: Remove dead code

2010-11-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5402] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): change powerState to
	  POWER_STATE_GRACE_PERIOD only if the previous state was
	  POWER_STATE_INUSE
	  
	  If the powerState was POWER_STATE_UNPOWERED then do NOT change to
	  POWER_STATE_GRACE_PERIOD. POWER_STATE_GRACE_PERIOD indicates that
	  the card is powered on. That is the case if mode is
	  SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT at SCardConnect()
	* [r5401] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): change the power state to
	  POWER_STATE_INUSE only if the card has been powered on. The card
	  is NOT powered on if mode is SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT
	* [r5400] src/eventhandler.c, src/readerfactory.c: Move the zeroing
	  of the reader context from EHDestroyEventHandler() to
	  RFUnInitializeReader() where it is more appropriate.
	  
	  The reader context shall be valid until the reader is
	  uninitialized in RFUnInitializeReader() and most importantly
	  after IFDCloseIFD() is called.
	* [r5399] src/readerfactory.c: RFInitializeReader(): if
	  IFDOpenIFD() fails just mark the reader as "not correctly
	  started". This will present a call to IFDCloseIFD() in
	  RFUnInitializeReader() (revision 5393)

2010-11-09  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5393] src/readerfactory.c: RFUnInitializeReader(): Do not close
	  a reader if IFDOpenIFD() failed in RFInitializeReader()
	* [r5392] src/readerfactory.c: RFRemoveReader(): destroy the event
	  handler only if it exists already

2010-11-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5391] src/winscard_msg_srv.c: ProcessCommonChannelRequest(): no
	  need to define serv_adr as static. Free a few bytes of memory.
	* [r5390] src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg.h,
	  src/winscard_msg_srv.c: Remove CleanupSharedSegment() and do not
	  call it anymore
	  
	  The function is not about shared segment any more The file
	  PCSCLITE_CSOCK_NAME will be removed in clean_temp_files() at exit
	  anyway
	* [r5388] src/winscard_msg.c: MessageSend(): return
	  SCARD_E_NO_SERVICE instead of SCARD_F_COMM_ERROR if the daemon
	  died and we reveice a EPIPE error.
	* [r5387] src/winscard_msg.c: MessageSendWithHeader(): do not send
	  a 0 length buffer.
	  
	  Some commands only have a header and no data like
	  CMD_GET_READERS_STATE
	* [r5386] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_svc.c: MessageReceiveTimeout(),
	  MessageSendWithHeader(), MessageSend() and MessageReceive() now
	  returns a PC/SC error code instead of an internal value. So the
	  callers can just return the error code to the application with no
	  transcoding.
	* [r5385] src/winscard_clnt.c: Move SCardInvalidateHandles() in the
	  same #ifdef DO_CHECK_SAME_PROCESS as SCardCheckSameProcess()
	  since it is only used in this case.
	* [r5384] src/winscard_clnt.c: No need to check the server pid
	  anymore. If the server is restarted the socket communication will
	  fail and an "RPC transport error" SCARD_F_COMM_ERROR error will
	  be returned
	  
	  This check was needed when the readers state was stored in
	  /var/run/pcscd/pcscd.pub. But that is no more the case. Every
	  command now uses the client/server Unix socket.

2010-11-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5379] src/winscard_msg.h: InitializeSocket() and
	  ProcessEventsServer() are used by the server side so must be
	  declared in the #ifdef PCSCD part of the header file
	* [r5378] src/winscard_msg.h: Add missing getSocketName()
	  declaration used by winscard_clnt.c and winscard_msg.c
	* [r5377] src/winscard_msg.h: Reorder the function definitions as
	  they are in winscard_msg.c in revision 5371
	* [r5376] src/readerfactory.h: Remove definition of FctMap_V1 now
	  useless since revision 5321
	* [r5375] src/atrhandler.c, src/atrhandler.h: Remove typedef of
	  PSMARTCARD_EXTENSION and use SMARTCARD_EXTENSION * instead

2010-11-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5373] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c: It is now
	  possible to configure the local socket name to use using the
	  environment variable PCSCLITE_CSOCK_NAME
	  
	  This is used by Estobuntu LTSP to redirect the smart card reader
	  on the light terminal display to the application running on the
	  server. They use a patched SSH version to redirect
	  /var/run/pcscd/pcscd.comm on the client to ~/.pcscd.comm on the
	  server.
	* [r5372] src/winscard_msg.c: MessageReceiveTimeout(): remove pcscd
	  specific code inside a function used only by libpcsclite
	* [r5371] src/winscard_msg.c: reorganize the functions in 3
	  categories: - functions used by pcscd only:
	  CleanupSharedSegment() - functions used by libpcsclite only:
	  ClientSetupSession(), ClientCloseSession(),
	  MessageReceiveTimeout(), MessageSendWithHeader() - functions used
	  by pcscd and libpcsclite: MessageSend(), MessageReceive()
	  
	  We gain on the code size: 1104 bytes for pcscd and 101 bytes for
	  libpcsclite

2010-11-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5370] src/atrhandler.c: ATRDecodeAtr(): avoids a buffer
	  overflow with badly formed ATR like 3B FF 11 22 33 F0 11 22 33 F0
	  11 22 33 F0 11 22 33 F0 11 22 33 F0 11 22 33 F0 11 22 33 00 11 22

2010-10-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5368] src/winscard.c: Move declaration of dwAtrLen closer to
	  where it is used.
	* [r5367] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): log the ATR in case of
	  auto power on
	  
	  The ATR may be different from the previous one if the card has a
	  cold and a warm ATR.

2010-10-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5364] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): check for card removal
	  in case DISABLE_AUTO_POWER_ON

	  client side (winscard_clnt.c) so remove documentation of

2010-10-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5348] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): check the returned value
	  of IFDPowerICC() to change the readerState if power up succeeded
	* [r5347] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): power up the card before
	  checking for its SCARD_SWALLOWED state.
	  
	  If a card fails to power up on card insertion a new power up will
	  be tried on SCardConnect().

2010-10-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5346] src/winscard_clnt.c: Remove the "This function " in the

	  src/misc.h, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard.c,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c: Remove spaces and tabs
	  at end of line
	* [r5342] src/winscard_svc.c: Reformat
	* [r5341] src/PCSC/winscard.h, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_svc.c: SCardCancelTransaction()
	  is no more provided. This function is not provided by Microsoft
	  and is deprecated since 2005 in pcsc-lite.
	* [r5340] src/winscard.c: Reindent
	* [r5339] src/winscard_clnt.c: Reformat
	* [r5338] src/PCSC/winscard.h, src/winscard_clnt.c:
	  SCardSetTimeout() is no more provided. This function is not
	  provided by Microsoft and is deprecated since 2004 in pcsc-lite.
	* [r5337] src/winscard.c: SCardSetTimeout() is implemented (and
	  deprecated) on the client side
	* [r5336] src/winscard.c: SCardListReaders() and SCardCancel() are
	  implemented on the client side
	* [r5335] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): if
	  DISABLE_AUTO_POWER_ON is defined then do not power on the card if
	  SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD is used.
	* [r5334] src/eventhandler.c, src/pcscd.h.in: Move
	  DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POWER_ON and DISABLE_AUTO_POWER_ON defines from
	  eventhandler.c to pcscd.h.in so they are visible by all the .c
	  files
	* [r5333] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): remove debug log

2010-10-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5332] src/eventhandler.c: If DISABLE_AUTO_POWER_ON is defined
	  then do not automatically power on the card. The card will be
	  powered on on the first SCardConnect()
	* [r5331] src/readerfactory.c: Remove extra parenthesis We are
	  using C not Lisp :-)
	* [r5328] TODO, src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h, src/eventhandler.c,
	  src/eventhandler.h, src/pcscd.h.in, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h, src/winscard.c: Power on the card _only_ if
	  an application requests a connection see Alioth bug #301965
	  
	  You can disable the feature using DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POWER_ON in
	  src/eventhandler.c

2010-10-17  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5324] src/Makefile.am: PCSC/reader.h is no more generated from
	  PCSC/reader.h.in Directly use the filename in
	  nobase_include_HEADERS

2010-10-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5323] UnitaryTests/SCardStatus.py: Add a call to
	  SCardDisconnect() before SCardReleaseContext()
	* [r5322] src/eventhandler.h, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c:
	  Rename the sharing states unsing the PCSCLITE_SHARING_ prefix
	  Doxygen: document the READER_STATE structure

	  src/ifdwrapper.c, src/ifdwrapper.h, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h: Remove the support of IFDHandler v1 API. I
	  don't know any driver using this API.
	  
	  We can now simplify the API of IFDStatusICC() and remove the ATR
	  related parameters. These paremeters were only used by the
	  IFDHandler v1 API.

	* [r5317] src/hotplug_libhal.c: ifdCapabilities driver feature is
	  not used with libhal (and has never been). Remove dead/unused
	  code.

2010-10-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5316] src/winscard.c: Reformat
	* [r5315] src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard.c: Use the simpler form
	  of IFDPowerICC(..., IFD_POWER_DOWN, ...) introduced in revision
	  5314
	* [r5314] src/ifdwrapper.c: IFDPowerICC(): allow to use NULL for
	  pucAtr and pdwAtrLen to make power down easy with
	  IFDPowerICC(rContext, IFD_POWER_DOWN, NULL, NULL);
	* [r5313] src/winscard.c: Correctly set dwAtrLen to the sizeof the
	  ATR array before calling IFDPowerICC().
	  
	  Some drivers do not write more that dwAtrLen bytes in cardAtr
	  array.

2010-10-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5308] src/winscard_msg.h: Doxygen: SCARD_GET_STATUS_CHANGE is
	  not used anymore
	* [r5307] src/winscard.c: Remove SCardStatus() (dead code) on the
	  server side.
	* [r5306] src/winscard.c: SCardEndTransaction(): use the same code
	  to reset a card as in revision 5301
	* [r5305] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(), SCardDisconnect() and
	  SCardEndTransaction(): reset the value of dwAtrLen before the
	  second call to IFDPowerICC() so that the driver gets a correct
	  value if the first call to IFDPowerICC(IFD_POWER_DOWN) set
	  dwAtrLen=0
	  
	  Thanks to Frank Morgner for the bug report Closes: [#312754]
	  IFDHPowerICC is called with IFD_POWER_UP and *AtrLength==0
	* [r5304] src/pcsc-wirecheck-gen.c, src/winscard.c,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_svc.c: A
	  large part of SCardStatus() is done on the client side using
	  readerStates[]. So remove a few lines of dead code on the server
	  side.
	* [r5303] UnitaryTests/SCardStatus.py: Call SCardStatus() a second
	  time after a keypress
	* [r5302] UnitaryTests/SCardStatus.py: Unit test for SCardStatus()
	* [r5301] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): Reorganize the code to
	  manage ATR and readerState after a power up. Remove a call to
	  IFDStatusICC() to know if a card is present or not since
	  IFDPowerICC() already gives us this information.
	  
	  SCardDisconnect(): Use the same code as above
	* [r5300] src/eventhandler.c, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c:
	  Use uint32_t readerState instead of DWORD dwStatus to store the
	  state of the reader. DWORD and uint32_t may be different.
	* [r5299] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): return
	  SCARD_E_NO_SMARTCARD when card is removed and
	  SCARD_W_UNRESPONSIVE_CARD when card is unresponsive instead of
	  SCARD_E_PROTO_MISMATCH
	* [r5298] src/winscard_msg.h: Increment minor version because of
	  changes in revision 5290
	* [r5297] doc/Makefile.am, doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: Remove the
	  deprecated LaTeX version of IFDHandler documentation

2010-10-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5296] src/configfile.l: evaluatetoken(): the CHANNELID
	  parameter can also be a decimal number.
	* [r5294] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h, src/configfile.l: reader.conf
	  configuration: If you want to use IFDHCreateChannel() instead of
	  IFDHCreateChannelByName() then do not use any DEVICENAME line in
	  the configuration file. IFDHCreateChannel() will then be called
	  with the CHANNELID parameter.
	  
	  Closes: [#312749] Should call IFDHCreateChannel for serial driver
	  with DEVICENAME /dev/null
	* [r5293] src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: list_* functions return an decimal integer so
	  use %d insteaf of %X to log the error value.
	* [r5292] src/readerfactory.c: Add a "0x" before hex displays

2010-10-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5291] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen SCardStatus(): *pdwState
	  also contains a number of events
	* [r5290] src/eventhandler.c, src/eventhandler.h,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c: Split the card event counter out of the card
	  event state on the pcscd side to simplify the code in
	  EHStatusHandlerThread()
	  
	  The two information are combined on the client side in
	  SCardGetStatusChange() and SCardStatus()
	* [r5289]
	  UnitaryTests/SCardGetStatusChange/SCardGetStatusChange_loop.py:
	  Exit the endless loop in case of error
	* [r5288] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: struct SCARD_READERSTATE: use
	  "DWORD" instead of "unsigned long" type for the fields
	  dwCurrentState, dwEventState and cbAtr
	  
	  This is compliant to the Windows definition and allows to
	  redefine DWORD to something other than unsigned long, like
	  uint32_t
	* [r5287] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in, src/error.c:
	  pcsc_stringify_error(): Use "LONG" instead of "long" as parameter
	  type to reflect the return type from winscard.h
	  
	  The LONG type may be redefined in PCSC/wintypes.h to int32_t for
	  example

2010-10-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5281] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen: do not document unused
	  SCARD_STATE_ATRMATCH and SCARD_STATE_PRESENT states in
	  SCardGetStatusChange()
	  
	  Thanks to Martin Paljak for the patch
	* [r5280]
	  UnitaryTests/SCardGetStatusChange/SCardGetStatusChange_loop.py:
	  Call SCardGetStatusChange() in a endless loop
	* [r5279] src/tokenparser.l: Doxygen: fix documentation of
	  LTPBundleFindValueWithKey()
	* [r5278] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): include the
	  event counter in dwEventState even if dwCurrentState contains a
	  counter at 0 (default).
	* [r5277] doc/doxygen.conf.in: Update from Doxygen 1.5.5 to 1.7.1
	  
	  warning: Tag `DETAILS_AT_TOP' at line 163 of file
	  doc/doxygen.conf has become obsolete. To avoid this warning
	  please update your configuration file using "doxygen -u"

2010-10-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5275] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): do not limit rights if run as
	  root

2010-09-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5262] src/Makefile.am: Do not change the access rights of pcscd
	  in the install rule but in another one. This is needed when
	  building the package in a system without the pcscd group.

2010-09-14  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5256] configure.in: Do not generate src/PCSC/reader.h from
	  src/PCSC/reader.h.in any more
	* [r5255] src/PCSC/reader.h: HOST_TO_CCID_16() and
	  HOST_TO_CCID_32() are now identity functions
	  
	  Since CCID 1.4.1 (revision 5252) the byte order is no more
	  important
	* [r5254] src/PCSC/reader.h, src/PCSC/reader.h.in: Rename
	  reader.h.in in reader.h

2010-09-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5245] src/Makefile.am: Install pcscd as sgid pcscd instead of
	  suid root
	* [r5241] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPReadBundleValues(): do not fail
	  if the key "CFBundleName" is not found in a driver Info.plist.
	  This key should only be defined for the CCID class driver.

2010-09-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5231] src/winscard_msg.c: Doxygen: remove documentation about
	  the (now removed) timeOut parameter of MessageSend() and
	  MessageSendWithHeader()

2010-09-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5227] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen: clarify the use of one
	  different SCARDCONTEXT per thread and the expection for
	  SCardCancel()
	* [r5226] src/winscard_svc.c: Remove protocol_major, protocol_minor
	  fields from struct _psContext since they are not used.
	* [r5225] src/winscard_msg.h: update PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR since
	  struct pubReaderStatesList changed (readerID removed)
	* [r5224] src/winscard_svc.c: ContextThread(): check that the
	  procotol major.minor is the same for the daemon and lib. If not
	  just fail. We are not backward compatible.
	* [r5219] src/winscard_clnt.c: Complete change in revision 5212
	  
	  SCardGetStatusChange() and SCardListReaders() were broken.
	* [r5218] src/ifdwrapper.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h: Rename lpcLibrary in library and lpcDevice
	  in device
	* [r5217] src/eventhandler.c, src/eventhandler.h, src/pcscdaemon.c,
	  src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: Wait until all
	  connected readers have a chance to power up a possibly inserted
	  card.
	  
	  This is needed when auto start is used and a card is already
	  present in a USB reader. The reader presence is correctly
	  reported to libpcsclite but the power up has not yet happen. So
	  the ATR is not yet available.
	* [r5216] src/eventhandler.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h, src/winscard_clnt.c: Rename lpcReaderName in
	  readerName and use (char *) instead of LPSTR
	* [r5215] src/eventhandler.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h, src/winscard.c: Get rid of the lpcReader[]
	  field in struct ReaderContext
	  
	  The reader name is already present in readerState->readerName
	  linked from struct ReaderContext
	  
	  Gain: MAX_READERNAME*PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS = 100*16 =
	  1600 bytes fo RAM on pcscd
	* [r5214] src/winscard.c: SCardStatus(): remove a useless test
	  
	  lpcReader can't be larger than MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (264) since its
	  buffer is only MAX_READERNAME (100) bytes long. And I don't see
	  why we need this test anyway.
	* [r5213] src/eventhandler.c, src/winscard.c: Complete change
	  started in revision 5212
	  
	  rContext->readerState is never NULL now. So do not even check its
	  value.
	* [r5212] src/eventhandler.c, src/eventhandler.h,
	  src/pcsc-wirecheck-gen.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c: Get rid of the readerID field in struct
	  pubReaderStatesList
	* [r5211] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: Remove unused
	  RFSuspendAllReaders() and RFAwakeAllReaders()

2010-08-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5204] src/eventhandler.c: Reformat

2010-08-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5202] src/winscard_msg_srv.c: InitializeSocket(): do not set
	  the execution bit on the socket file. It is useless.

2010-08-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5196] src/debug.c, src/error.c, src/utils.c, src/utils.h: svn
	  propset svn:keywords 'Author Date Id Revision'
	* [r5195] src/utils.c: GetDaemonPid(): use open(3) instead of
	  fopen(3) to avoid an internal malloc() call and gain some CPU
	  cycles
	* [r5194] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPAddDevice(): wait 1 millisecond
	  instead of 1 second until the device is visible to libusb/etc.

2010-08-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5183] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen:
	  SCardCheckDaemonAvailability() do not invalidate handles after a
	  fork() any more

2010-08-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5179] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPReadBundleValues(): use the new
	  Info.plist parsing API.
	  
	  Parsing the CCID Info.plist (159 readers supported) was on a ARM9
	  machine 13193049 µs and is now 258262 µs => gain x51 or 5008%
	* [r5178] src/readerfactory.c: RFBindFunctions(): rename rv in rvl
	  to avoid warnings warning: declaration of ‘rv’ shadows a previous
	  local
	  
	  Also change type from DWORD to int since DYN_GetAddress() returns
	  an int
	* [r5177] src/readerfactory.c: RFLoadReader(): optimize the
	  detection of Ifd Handler version by checking for
	  "IFDHCreateChannelByName", "IFDHCreateChannel" and then
	  "IO_Create_Channel" instead of the 3 symbols at once.
	  
	  Also suppress the error message suppression. Ifd handler v2 or v1
	  will display one or two errors for symbols not found.
	* [r5175] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPReadBundleValues(): duplicate the
	  readerName and CFBundleName strings since the originals are
	  destroyed by bundleRelease() later
	  
	  The reader names were corrupted.

2010-08-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5160] ChangeLog: Fix typo

2010-08-17  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5157] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPReadBundleValues(): use the new
	  Info.plist parsing API.
	  
	  Parsing the CCID Info.plist (159 readers supported) was on a i386
	  machine 264306 µs and is now 5547 µs => gain x47 or 4600%
	* [r5156] src/parser.h, src/tokenparser.l: parse the Info.plist
	  file only once and generate a list of key/values
	* [r5152] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPSearchHotPluggables(): create the
	  synchronisation pipe only if the HPEstablishUSBNotifications
	  thread is created. Avoids to leak resources.
	* [r5151] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPSearchHotPluggables(): wait for
	  initial readers to setup only if HPEstablishUSBNotifications is
	  created. Otherwise the process is blocked for ever.
	* [r5150] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPRegisterForHotplugEvents():
	  having no bundle for USB readers is not an error. USB
	  support/hotplug is just disabled.
	* [r5149] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): Log a message if
	  HPRegisterForHotplugEvents() fails
	* [r5148] src/hotplug_libusb.c: Do not hardcode the libusb-1.0
	  include header path (remove the libusb-1.0/ part)

2010-08-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5147] configure.in: Do not hardcode the libusb.h path.
	  
	  See Debian bug #591782 ccid: FTBFS on kfreebsd-*: configure:
	  error: libusb.h not found
	* [r5146] c.sh: add --sysconfdir=/etc
	* [r5145] src/pcscdaemon.c: Do not allow restricting defaults
	  values of --max-thread, --max-card-handle-per-thread or
	  --max-card-handle-per-reader when restricted
	* [r5144] src/pcscdaemon.c: Do not allow APDU logging when
	  restricted
	* [r5143] src/pcscdaemon.c: If the process is setuid or setgid it
	  may have some restrictions
	  
	  Do not allow to specify a configuration file when restricted

2010-08-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5138] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.6.4
	* [r5137] configure.in: Do not use sysconfdir as configuration
	  directory but ${sysconfdir}/reader.conf.d instead.
	  
	  Use --enable-confdir=DIR if you want to set a specific value
	  without the reader.conf.d appended.
	  
	  Thanks to Kalev Lember for the bug report
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2010-q3/0150.html
	* [r5135] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.6.3
	* [r5134] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in, src/PCSC/winscard.h: Define
	  LPSCARD_READERSTATE since this is used in the MSDN prototype.
	  
	  Use LPSCARD_READERSTATE in winscard.h instead of
	  (SCARD_READERSTATE *) to mimic the MSDN API.
	  
	  This partly reverts changeset 5096

2010-08-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5130] UnitaryTests/SCard_fork.py: Also call SCardDisconnect()
	  and SCardReleaseContext() in the forked process
	* [r5129] src/winscard_svc.c: ContextThread(): goto exit if
	  MSGCheckHandleAssociation() fails instead of just returning no
	  error.
	  
	  Something wrong happened on the client side (like a fork) and the
	  client needs to call SCardEstablishContext() to create a new
	  connection.
	* [r5128] src/winscard_svc.c: ContextThread(): fix goto label when
	  it _is_ an overflow
	* [r5127] src/winscard_svc.c: ContextThread(): fix goto label when
	  it is not an overflow
	* [r5126] src/winscard_clnt.c: Revert changeset 5102 to add
	  profiling on the client side again.
	  
	  ltrace(1) can't be used with a dynamically loaded (dlopen(3))
	  library like it is the case with the majority of PKCS#11 client
	  application.
	* [r5125] src/simclist.c: Reset mid field when the list is empty to
	  avoid assert() errors
	* [r5124] src/winscard_svc.c: MSGCheckHandleAssociation(): check
	  that the context handle is still valid. Calling a PC/SC function
	  after SCardReleaseContext() is not supported.
	* [r5123] src/eventhandler.c: Fix typo in comment

2010-08-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5118] configure.in: remove debug line
	* [r5117] configure.in: "/reader.conf.d" is only appended to
	  sysconfdir if no value of sysconfdir is provided
	  
	  Thanks to Patrice Angelini for the bug report
	* [r5114] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPAddHotPluggable(): do not use
	  libusb_strerror() since it is not yet available in current stable
	  libusb (1.0.8)
	* [r5113] src/ifdwrapper.c: Fix compilation warnings
	  ifdwrapper.c:166:7: warning: "IFDHANDLERv2" is not defined
	  ifdwrapper.c:589:7: warning: "IFDHANDLERv2" is not defined
	  ifdwrapper.c:640:7: warning: "IFDHANDLERv3" is not defined
	* [r5112] src/ifdwrapper.c: Check that either IFDHANDLERv1,
	  IFDHANDLERv2 or IFDHANDLERv3 is defined if PCSCLITE_STATIC_DRIVER
	  is used
	* [r5111] c.sh: No need to use -D_REENTRANT. It was needed for
	  LinuxThreads but we do not use LinuxThreads since a long time.
	  
	  See Debian bug #475101 "Remove obsolete -D_REENTRANT requirement"

2010-08-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5107] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.6.2
	* [r5106] src/Makefile.am: Remove useless $(COREFOUNDATION) from
	  libpcsclite_la_LIBADD The library has no Mac OS X specific code.
	* [r5105] src/Makefile.am: Remove undefined $(LIBSMARTCARD) from
	  libpcsclite_la_LIBADD
	* [r5104] src/Makefile.am: libpcsclite does not use dlopen() so no
	  need to link with $(LIBDL)

2010-08-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r5102] src/winscard_clnt.c: Remove client side profiling since
	  we can use ltrace(1) with better results
	* [r5098] configure.in: Remove 2 debug traces

2010-08-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	  Thanks to Kalev Lember for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2010-q3/0015.html
	  
	  > URL: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pcsclite/?sc=1&rev=5060 > Log:
	  set --sysconfdir=/etc/reader.conf.d so that we parse any file in
	  > this directory > > [...] > - --sysconfdir=/etc \ > +
	  --sysconfdir=/etc/reader.conf.d \
	  
	  It's more common to set sysconfdir to /etc and have configure
	  script figure out the subdirectory. The configure script should
	  always default to sane values when no arguments are specified.
	  The default value for sysconfdir is /usr/local/etc; so the
	  configure script should just append /reader.conf.d to that. Right
	  now if the user doesn't override sysconfdir, pcsc will try to go
	  through every .conf file in /usr/local/etc, and I don't think
	  anything good will come out of that.
	  
	  I have a patch attached which should make it more idiomatic:
	  default to $sysconfdir/reader.conf.d directory.

	  Before the patch pcscd became a daemon, then returned 0 (success)
	  and then continued with the initialisation. If the initialisation

	  The constants PCSCLITE_WRITE_TIMEOUT & PCSCLITE_READ_TIMEOUT are

	  The problem was that if a client does nothing during
	  PCSCLITE_READ_TIMEOUT (120 seconds by default) then pcscd
	  considers it as a dead client and closes the connection. I guess
	  this problem was present since the first version of pcsc-lite but

	  DEBUG (SCARD_S_SUCCESS) or ERROR (every thing else) level

2010-04-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4866] UnitaryTests/reset_card.py: reset a card using
	  SCardDisconnect (default) or SCardReconnect (if an argument is
	  passed)
	* [r4865] UnitaryTests/transmit_loop.py: call SCardTransmit in an
	  endless loop
	* [r4864] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): mimic the code from
	  SCardDisconnect() regarding card event state notifications
	  (changed in revision 4862).
	* [r4863] UnitaryTests/Makefile: no more pcsc_demo target
	* [r4862] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): Set the card event
	  state to SCARD_RESET _before_ doing the reset.
	  
	  This will avoid an SCardTransmit from another application between
	  the card reset and the card event state change. In the
	  problematic case the SCardTransmit was sending an APDU in T=1 to
	  a reseted card but not yet configured (IFDHSetProtocolParameters
	  was not yet called) and still in T=0 (default)
	* [r4861] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect() & SCardReconnect():
	  correctly log SCARD_PROTOCOL_RAW protocol instead of "unknown"

2010-04-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4859] src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c: Fix copyright
	  name and date
	* [r4858] src/winscard_msg.c: Doxygen: document SHMMessageReceive()
	  command argument added in revision 4718
	* [r4857] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen:
	  SCARD_ATTR_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME is implemented by
	  SCardGetAttrib() if the IFD Handler (driver) returns
	  IFD_ERROR_TAG. pcsc-lite then returns the same reader name as
	  returned by SCardListReaders.

2010-04-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4851] src/PCSC/reader.h.in: Add PCSCv2_PART10_PROPERTY_*
	  defines

2010-03-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4845] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContext(): try to
	  relaunch pcscd if SCardCheckDaemonAvailability() succeeds but
	  SCardEstablishContextTH() fails. This happens if pcscd crashed
	  without cleaning /var/run/pcscd/pcscd.comm

2010-03-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4843] src/PCSC/reader.h.in: add FEATURE_GET_TLV_PROPERTIES and
	  FEATURE_CCID_ESC_COMMAND from PC/SC part 10 v2.02.07 March 2010

2010-03-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4839] src/pcscdaemon.c: Call at_exit() instead of exit() since
	  the libC of Android is bogus and atexit() does not work as it
	  should.
	  
	  Thanks to Patrice Angelini for the bug report.
	* [r4838] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardCheckDaemonAvailability(): use
	  stat(2) instead of the now removed SYS_Stat()

2010-03-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4836] src/configfile.l, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/sys_generic.h,
	  src/sys_unix.c, src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: Remove the one line wrappers from sys_unix.c
	  and use directly the POSIX functions instead.

2010-03-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4825] src/Makefile.am: Install pcscd as suid so that autostart
	  works correctly (as root)
	* [r4824] TODO: done: remove as much text messages (logs) as
	  possible
	* [r4823] configure.in: Display PCSCLITE_FEATURES
	* [r4822] configure.in: Add --enable-embedded (default is no) to
	  build pcsc-lite for an embedded system. This will activate the
	  NO_LOG option to disable logging and limit RAM and disk
	  consumption.
	* [r4821] src/PCSC/debuglog.h, src/debug.c, src/debuglog.c,
	  src/hotplug_libhal.c, src/winscard_svc.c: If NO_LOG is defined
	  then no log are displayed. The idea is to limit the binaries size
	  on disk and RAM consumption at execution time.
	  
	  With NO_LOG defined we gain 26% (17 kB) for the .text segment of
	  pcscd and 15% (4 kB) for the .text segment of libpcsclite.so (for
	  i386)
	* [r4820] src/utils.c: Include config.h before the other header
	  files so the configuration set in config.h can be used in the
	  other header files (NO_LOG for example)
	* [r4819] src/configfile.l: Include config.h before the other
	  header files so the configuration set in config.h can be used in
	  the other header files (NO_LOG for example)
	* [r4818] src/Makefile.am, src/debug.c, src/debug.h,
	  src/dyn_hpux.c, src/dyn_macosx.c, src/dyn_unix.c, src/sys_unix.c,
	  src/tokenparser.l, src/utils.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.c: Remove debug.h and use debuglog.h instead.
	  They both define the same log API.

2010-03-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4813] UnitaryTests/ThreadSafe.py,
	  UnitaryTests/ThreadSafeConnect.py: revert change in revision 4812
	  since the problem is now solved in pyscard (revision 382)
	* [r4812] UnitaryTests/ThreadSafe.py,
	  UnitaryTests/ThreadSafeConnect.py: do not initialise the library
	  in a thread as it crashed on Mac OS X

2010-03-09  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4809] src/winscard_svc.c: read only accesses to contextsList
	  list shall also be protected by a mutex
	* [r4808] src/readerfactory.c: read only accesses to handlesList
	  list shall also be protected by a mutex
	* [r4807] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: manipulations
	  of handlesList field of ReaderContext should now be thread safe
	* [r4806] src/winscard_svc.c: MSGRemoveContext(): correctly indent
	  a line
	* [r4805] src/winscard_svc.c: manipulations of cardsList should now
	  be thread safe
	* [r4804] src/winscard_svc.c: remove extra tab
	* [r4803] UnitaryTests/ThreadSafeConnect.py: add more logging
	* [r4802] UnitaryTests/ThreadSafeConnect.py: stress thread safeness
	  of SCardConnect/SCardDisconnect
	* [r4801] src/winscard_svc.c: manipulations of contextsList should
	  now be thread safe
	* [r4800] UnitaryTests/ThreadSafe.py: stress thread safeness

	  import
	* [r4789] UnitaryTests/MCT_ReaderDirect.py,
	  UnitaryTests/control_get_firmware.py,
	  UnitaryTests/control_switch_interface.py: use list comprehension
	  instead of map() (more efficient and pylint does not like map())

2010-03-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4788] UnitaryTests/control_switch_interface.py: make pylint
	  happier

2010-03-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4784] src/debuglog.c: debuglog.c is only used by pcscd. So no
	  need to use #ifdef PCSCD

2010-03-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4783] TODO: fix typo

2010-02-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4779] configure.in, doc/Makefile.am,
	  doc/update-reader.conf.8.in, etc/Makefile.am,
	  etc/update-reader.conf.in, src/configfile.h, src/configfile.l,
	  src/readerfactory.c: Add the ability to parse all the
	  configuration files of a directory instead of just one
	  configuration file. update-reader.conf is then now obsolete.
	  
	  See Debian bug #565896 http://bugs.debian.org/565896

2010-02-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4778] src/pcscdaemon.c: update copyright

2010-02-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4769] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContextTH() &

	  socketcall.send(msg) points to uninitialised byte(s)
	* [r4768] UnitaryTests/SCardBlockingBehaviourTest.py: As of
	  revision r4719 Linux is now Windows "compatible"

2010-02-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4766] src/misc.h: " The gcc on Solaris 10 combined with the Sun
	  loader appears to not handle the gcc visibility attribute
	  correctly. The sparc version says it is ignored, the x86 version
	  gives linker error. The attached patch sun.gcc.1.5.6-svn-477.txt
	  tries to test for gcc on Sun and not use the visibility
	  attribute. If on a sun and the compiler is not GCC, try and use
	  the Sun __global and __hidden instead. (I did not try the Sun
	  Studio compiler with this.) "

2010-02-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4708] configure.in, src/pcscd.h.in: Use the standard
	  --sysconfdir=DIR ($prefix/etc by default) instead of
	  --enable-confdir=DIR for defining the directory containing
	  reader.conf
	* [r4707] configure.in: sysconfdir_exp is a configuration directory
	  not configuration file

2010-02-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4705] src/winscard.c: SCardStatus(): returns
	  SCARD_E_SHARING_VIOLATION if the reader is already used More
	  conform to Windows
	* [r4704] UnitaryTests/SCardBlockingBehaviourTest.py: allow to use
	  any reader and not just the first one
	* [r4703] src/testpcsc.c: test SCARD_ATTR_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME
	* [r4702] src/winscard.c: SCardGetAttrib(): add support of
	  SCARD_ATTR_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME as it is better implemented in
	  pcscd (it knows the friendly name)
	* [r4701] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContext(): set
	  PCSCLITE_PCSCD_ARGS with the argument you want to pass to pcscd
	  in autostart Only one argument is passed. The space character is
	  not a separator. example: export PCSCLITE_PCSCD_ARGS=-dfa
	* [r4700] src/pcscd.h.in, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: pcscd will suicide itself after 60 seconds of
	  inactivity if it is started using --auto-exit This is the default
	  behavior when pcscd is started by libpcsclite
	* [r4699] src/pcscdaemon.c: do not ignore the SIGALRM signal any
	  more since we need it for the auto exit feature

2010-01-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4685] configure.in: add $host to the PCSCLITE_FEATURES
	  definition (available with "pcscd -v") to display the CPU
	  architecture host is something like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
	* [r4683] configure.in: use LT_INIT(disable-static) instead of the
	  deprecated AM_DISABLE_STATIC
	  
	  Thanks to Roumen Petrov

2010-01-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4682] UnitaryTests/MCT_ReaderDirect.py,
	  UnitaryTests/control_get_firmware.py,
	  UnitaryTests/control_switch_interface.py: do not try to reset the
	  card on exit. We are talking to the reader. A card may NOT be
	  present.
	* [r4681] configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Do not completely disable
	  building the static version of the library but just disable it by
	  default
	  
	  Use AM_DISABLE_STATIC in configure.in instead of -shared in
	  Makefile.am

2010-01-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4674] UnitaryTests/SCardBlockingBehaviourTest.py: Check the
	  behavior of PCSC functions when a PCSC transaction is ongoing
	  
	  Thanks to Jean-Luc Giraud for the original code
	* [r4673] src/Makefile.am: use -shared to only provide a shared
	  library. If you need to use the static .a library you just need
	  to remove -shared

2010-01-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4672] UnitaryTests/control_switch_interface.py: parse error
	  code
	* [r4671] UnitaryTests/control_switch_interface.py: improve
	  documentation and output
	* [r4670] src/winscard_clnt.c: Only call SCardCheckSameProcess() if
	  DO_CHECK_SAME_PROCESS is defined (default is not defined).
	  
	  Some thread libraries (on embedded systems for example) have a
	  different pid for each thread of a same process. So the check
	  using getpid() is wrong and handles are invalidated when they
	  should not. The PC/SC function returned SCARD_E_INVALID_HANDLE
	* [r4669] src/winscard_clnt.c: define and use the
	  CHECK_SAME_PROCESS macro instead of calling
	  SCardCheckSameProcess() directly

2010-01-14  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4668] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen: update
	  SCardGetStatusChange() doc. The function returns on any events,

	* [r4667] TODO: For embedded/constained systems
	  
	  - remove as much text messages (logs) as possible to limit the
	  size of the binaries (pcscd and libpcsclite)
	  
	  - use static driver instead of reader polling and dynamic driver
	  loading

2010-01-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4646] src/readerfactory.c: RFInitializeReader(): do not
	  dynamically load the driver if PCSCLITE_STATIC_DRIVER is defined
	* [r4645] src/ifdwrapper.c: better support of
	  PCSCLITE_STATIC_DRIVER.
	  
	  This is used to statically link the reader driver to pcscd. Since
	  the link is static you must define the IFDHandler API version at

	  different on Windows

2009-11-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4574] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in, src/error.c: remove pcsc-lite

	* [r4527] src/readerfactory.h, src/thread_generic.h,
	  src/thread_unix.c, src/winscard_clnt.c: remove the type
	  PCSCLITE_MUTEX_T and use an explicit pointer type (PCSCLITE_MUTEX
	  *) instead
	  
	  This should avoid bugs like the one corrected in revision 4525
	* [r4525] src/eventhandler.c: correctly use the lock API for

	* [r4524] src/pcscdaemon.c, src/readerfactory.c,

2009-10-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r4491] src/Makefile.am: do not use PCSC_CLIENT_SRC variable

	* [r4490] src/Makefile.am: libpcsclite does not need to have

	  DYN_LoadLibrary/DYN_CloseLibrary/DYN_GetAddress
	* [r4489] pbx, pcsc.pbproj: remove Xcode files. Apple has its own
	  version of pcsc-lite for Mac OS X
	* [r4488] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen(): better documentation for

	* [r4487] src/winscard_clnt.c: revert changeset 4485.

	* [r4486] configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/winscard_scf.c: remove
	  SCF support (PC/SC over Smart Card Framework). I never used this

	* [r4480] src/winscard_msg.c: SHMMessageSend(): use send(...,

	* [r4453] src/pcscd.h.in, src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard_clnt.c:

	* [r4436] src/utils.c, src/utils.h: remove now useless

	  src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_msg_srv.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: redesign the client/server communication: -
	  no more shared memory used (allow pcscd and libpcsclite1.so to be
	  on different computer and talk over a network) - no more
	  difference between short and extended APDU - no more use of a
	  /var/run/pcscd/pcscd.events/ directory. events are sent through
	  the socket - simpler command format between client and server
	  
	  The side effect is that you are not able to mix an old pcscd with
	  a new libpcsclite1.so or the reverse. SCardEstablishContext()
	  will fail unless you update both sides of the communication.
	* [r4433] src/winscard_msg.c: reformat comment

	* [r3200] src/readerfactory.c: RFRemoveReader(): symplify a test
	* [r3197] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPAddHotPluggable(): correctly

	  Thanks to Ludovic LANGE for the patch. Closes: [#311215] Fix for
	  libusb hotplug garbage when serial number is empty

2008-10-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3190] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): use |=
	  instead of = to set SCARD_STATE_CHANGED bit in case (dwState &
	  SCARD_UNKNOWN)

2008-10-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3184] Makefile.am: add --reparagraph to svn2cl arguments

2008-10-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3180] src/winscard_clnt.c: move definition of time_sub() before
	  its first use

2008-10-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3179] src/ifdwrapper.c: reformat lock/unlock comments

2008-10-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3178] src/ifdwrapper.c, src/winscard.c: move locking from
	  IFDSetPTS() to 2 levels above in SCardConnect() and
	  SCardReconnect(). The value of
	  rContext->readerState->cardProtocol is then checked and modified
	  in an atomic transaction
	  
	  This avoids to renegociate the protocol and confuse the card if
	  two applications perform a SCardConnect() at the same time (after
	  they are both blocked by SCardGetStatusChange() and a card is
	  inserted for example)
	  
	  Error returned by CCID driver is: CCID_Receive Procedure byte
	  conflict

2008-10-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3171] src/winscard.c: #include "utils.h"

	  ‘StatSynchronize’

2008-10-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3160] src/utils.c: SendHotplugSignal(): wait for 1 second after

	  did not noticed
	* [r3159] c.sh: remove --disable-libhal
	* [r3158] src/eventhandler.c: EHStatusHandlerThread(): remove
	  commented and never used code to restart a reader after 10
	  IFDStatusICC() errors

2008-10-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3157] src/hotplug_libhal.c, src/hotplug_libusb.c: call
	  CheckForOpenCT() if RFAddReader() fails.
	  
	  The first cause of pcsc-lite failure is that OpenCT is installed
	  and running and has already claimed the USB device. In that case
	  RFAddReader() fails and I get a user support request
	* [r3156] src/utils.c, src/utils.h: add CheckForOpenCT()

2008-09-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3146] src/ifdwrapper.c: IFDCloseIFD(): give up to 500 ms to the
	  mutex to be free if the lock failed. Maybe a polling thread is
	  still using the device on another slot.
	* [r3145] src/utils.c: StatSynchronize(): log and return if
	  opendir() fails
	  
	  Avoids a crash when started without root privileges

2008-09-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3142] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPAddDevice(): remove a debug
	  printf()

2008-09-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3125] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardStatus(): allow NULL for
	  pcchReaderLen and pcbAtrLen
	  
	  You can then use SCardStatus(hCard, pcReaders, &dwReaderLen,
	  NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) to only get the reader name or
	  SCardStatus(hCard, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, pbAtr, &dwAtrLen) to
	  only get the card ATR or even SCardStatus(hCard, NULL, NULL,
	  NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) to get nothing except SCARD_S_SUCCESS
	* [r3124] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardStatus(), SCardGetAttrib(),
	  SCardListReaders(), SCardListReaderGroups(): check that the
	  pointer argument used to store the allocated memory in case of
	  SCARD_AUTOALLOCATE is not NULL.
	  
	  return SCARD_E_INVALID_PARAMETER instead of crashing

2008-09-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3119] src/utils.c: StatSynchronize(): log with level DEBUG
	  instead of ERROR if errno is ENXIO "No such device or address"
	  since it is a normal error if the client is no more listening the
	  pipe
	* [r3118] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): move "Event
	  Loop End" log after the end label so the log is displayed
	* [r3117] src/winscard_clnt.c: WaitForPcscdEvent(): remove the
	  waiting for event file after use
	* [r3116] src/hotplug_libhal.c: HPAddDevice(): the device serial is
	  "usb.serial" instead of "usb_device.serial" and it is a C-string
	  instead of an int

2008-09-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3112] src/winscard_clnt.c: Doxygen: move SCardSetTimeout (back)
	  in the API group so the detailed documentation does not appear in

	  timeout every 1 second on Linux.
	  
	  We do timeout only on *BSD like in SHMProcessEventsServer()

2008-08-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3103] src/eventhandler.c, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c:

	  SCardGetStatusChange()
	  
	  on client side use WaitForPcscdEvent() instead of
	  SYS_USleep(PCSCLITE_STATUS_WAIT)
	  
	  on server side use StatSynchronize() instead of
	  SYS_MMapSynchronize()
	* [r3102] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): use k
	  instead of i warning: declaration of 'i' shadows a previous local
	* [r3101] src/winscard_clnt.c: move time_sub() outside of #ifdef
	  DO_PROFILE
	* [r3100] src/pcscd.h.in: define PCSCLITE_EVENTS_DIR
	* [r3099] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): create PCSCLITE_EVENTS_DIR
	  directory clean_temp_files(): purge & remove PCSCLITE_EVENTS_DIR
	  directory

	  access mode in case umask is too restrictive

2008-08-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r3081] src/readerfactory.h: #include "pcscd.h" to get
	  definitions MAX_LIBNAME, MAX_DEVICENAME,
	  PCSCLITE_MAX_READER_CONTEXT_CHANNELS
	* [r3080] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): call SYS_OpenFile() with the
	  modes used by SYS_Chmod() and remove useless SYS_Chmod() call
	* [r3079] src/eventhandler.c: EHInitializeEventStructures(): call
	  SYS_OpenFile() with the modes used by SYS_Chmod() and remove

	  SCardConnect(), SCardReconnect(), SCardDisconnect(),
	  SCardEndTransaction(): do not check parameters for
	  SCARD_E_INVALID_VALUE since these tests are also done on the
	  server side. Do not duplicate code
	* [r2955] src/pcscdaemon.c: SVCServiceRunLoop(): return if
	  HPSearchHotPluggables() fails
	* [r2954] src/pcscdaemon.c: SVCServiceRunLoop(): return if

2008-04-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2915] src/winscard_clnt.c: return the returned value of

	  Thanks to Alon Bar-Lev for bug report

2008-04-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2910] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardCheckDaemonAvailability():
	  invalidate all handles if the application has forked and we are

	  Thanks to Alon Bar-Lev for the bug report and the patch
	* [r2909] src/testpcsc.c: better management of corner cases

	  Thanks to Alon Bar-Lev for the bug report
	* [r2898] src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_msg_srv.c,

2008-03-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2845] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardReleaseContext(): remove the

2008-02-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2839] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardReleaseContext(): revert

	  Thanks to Eric Walter for the bug report

2008-01-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2732] src/debug.c: default log level is PCSC_LOG_CRITICAL+1 so

	  test_rv() The type was wrong on amd64 since the sign was extended
	* [r2705] src/testpcsc.c: only display the result of SCardControl()
	  if it succeeded

2007-11-09  Ludovic Rousseau

2007-05-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2546] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.4.2
	* [r2545] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): do not block if
	  dwDisposition == SCARD_LEAVE_CARD.
	  
	  We block only for SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD, SCARD_RESET_CARD and
	  SCARD_EJECT_CARD since that would impact other running
	  transactions
	* [r2544] src/eventhandler.c, src/eventhandler.h,
	  src/readerfactory.c: lockState field of READER_STATE was not
	  used. Remove it and the associated dead code

	  counter so that SCardBeginTransaction/SCardEndTransaction can be
	  nested
	* [r2542] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardTransmit(): adjust size of data
	  to send to pcscd. Avoid a valgrind warnings.
	* [r2541] src/testpcsc.c: no need to initialise pioRecvPci. It is a
	  out only variable
	* [r2540] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardTransmit(): we do not need to
	  correctly initialize scTransmitStruct.pioRecvPci since it is only

	  SCardCheckDaemonAvailability() from winscard_clnt.c to utils.h

	* [r2537] src/PCSC/wintypes.h: LPTSTR and LPCTSTR types are no more
	  deprecated since they are found in many applications. And using
	  them is not a problem.
	* [r2536] src/testpcsc.c: initialise pioRecvPci before using it
	* [r2535] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c: Initialize
	  memory to avoid valgrind warnings: Syscall param write(buf)
	  points to uninitialised byte(s)
	* [r2534] src/winscard.c: use sizeof() instead of a constant

2007-05-16  Ludovic Rousseau

2007-05-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2528] src/winscard_msg.c: SHMMessageReceive(): on the client
	  side, if the daemon does not respond after 2 minutes
	  (PCSCLITE_CLIENT_ATTEMPTS) we call SCardCheckDaemonAvailability()
	  to be sure the daemon is still there and continue waiting.
	  
	  Thanks to Harsh Sangal for the bug report

	  SCardCheckDaemonAvailability()

2007-05-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2513] TODO: "poll the reader only if an application is using
	  this reader"
	* [r2512] TODO: "do not use an active polling in hotplug_libusb.c"
	  solved using IFD_GENERATE_HOTPLUG

2007-04-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2507] src/pcscd.h.in: USE_IPCDIR is always defined. The default
	  value is set by ./configure
	* [r2506] configure.in: use $ipcdir/pcscd.pid as the default value
	  for so that the use of --enable-runpid=FILE is not mandatory

	  compiler warning: no previous prototype for ‘test_rv’
	* [r2502] src/Makefile.am: client and server use utils.c
	* [r2501] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardCheckDaemonAvailability(): when
	  the _first_ reader is connected _after_ pcscd has started the
	  ctime of PCSCLITE_PUBSHM_FILE changes (no idea why)
	  
	  So to be sure a new pcscd is running we also check the pcscd pid
	  available from USE_RUN_PID
	* [r2500] src/pcscdaemon.c, src/utils.c, src/utils.h: move
	  GetDaemonPid() in utils.c so we can also use it elsewhere

2007-03-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	  Thanks to Matheus Ribeiro for the bug report
	* [r2496] src/eventhandler.c, src/winscard_clnt.c:

	  returning SCARD_E_SHARING_VIOLATION

2007-03-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2474] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: define RESPONSECODE type only if

	  compile the driver with an old pcsc-lite)

2007-03-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2467] src/winscard_svc.c: CreateContextThread(): avoid a buffer

	  thanks to Petr Gajdos for the patch
	* [r2466] src/winscard.c: improve Doxygen
	* [r2465] src/testpcsc.c: when we are waiting for a card insertion
	  a reader may be connected/disconnected so SCardGetStatusChange()
	  will return but a card is not inserted
	* [r2464] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardCheckDaemonAvailability(): if
	  the daemon is restarted we invalidate all the existing handles so
	  SCard functions returns SCARD_E_INVALID_HANDLE
	* [r2463] src/winscard_clnt.c: add prototype for SCardUnload()
	* [r2462] src/winscard_clnt.c: move code from SCardRemoveContext()

	  SCardRemoveContext()
	* [r2461] src/winscard_clnt.c: move call to
	  SCardCheckDaemonAvailability() from SCardEstablishContextTH() to
	  SCardEstablishContext() to move it oustide of
	  SCardLockThread()/SCardUnlockThread() since
	  SCardCheckDaemonAvailability() may also lock (and then deadlock)
	* [r2460] src/pcscd.h: Oops. pcscd.h.in is already in SVN
	* [r2459] src/pcscd.h: new file

2007-03-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	  SCARD_E_INVALID_HANDLE if the daemon has been restarted
	* [r2457] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardCheckDaemonAvailability():

	  SCARD_E_NO_SERVICE in that case

2007-02-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2449] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContextTH(): call
	  fcntl(mapAddr, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC); to close on exec the file
	  descriptor on /var/run/pcscd.pub so that child processes do not
	  inherits it. The child process will call SCardEstablishContext()
	  if needed.

2007-02-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2447] src/PCSC/wintypes.h: the comment about LPTSTR was wrong

2007-02-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	  svn2cl.sh
	* [r2385] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): call SYS_USleep() to
	  "allow the status thread to convey information" only if the
	  application requests SCARD_RESET_CARD or SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD. We
	  do not wait if the application requests SCARD_LEAVE_CARD.
	* [r2384] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): call SYS_USleep() to
	  "allow the status thread to convey information" only if the

	  SCardBeginTransaction() client and server side: call SYS_USleep()

	  not overwrite the value specified with --force-reader-polling=val

	* [r2233] src/atrhandler.c: Doxygen ATRDecodeAtr()
	* [r2232] src/hotplug_libusb.c: remove the driver field from struct
	  readerTracker use the fullName field to check if the reader entry

2006-11-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2209] configure.in: version 1.3.3
	* [r2204] src/ifdwrapper.c: if a driver command returns
	  IFD_NO_SUCH_DEVICE we call SendHotplugSignal() to rescan the
	  USB/serial/etc. readers and purge the removed readers from the
	  reader list
	* [r2203] src/hotplug.h: add SendHotplugSignal() prototype
	* [r2202] src/pcscdaemon.c: reorganise code to create

2006-10-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2193] src/hotplug_libusb.c, src/pcscdaemon.c: check for rescan

	  specific to libusb

2006-10-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2192] src/hotplug_libusb.c: move code of
	  HPEstablishUSBNotifications() into a new function
	  HPRescanUsbBus()
	  
	  HPRescanUsbBus() is called: - periodically from
	  HPEstablishUSBNotifications() if USB_POLLING is defined - by
	  HPReCheckSerialReaders() when a SIGUSR1 signal is received so we
	  can use udev hotplug events to rescan the USB bus instead of

	  ReCheckSerialReaders
	* [r2190] src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c:
	  SHMProcessEventsServer(): returns -2 in case of syscall
	  interrupted (EINTR) and -1 for other errors.
	  
	  SVCServiceRunLoop(): do not log an error message in case of -2
	  since it happens when SIGUSR1 (reload) or SIGINT (Ctrl-C) is
	  received. We just try again
	* [r2189] src/pcscdaemon.c: main(): fail if hotplug is requested
	  but no pcscd is running

2006-10-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2188] src/misc.h: do not use visibility("default") for gcc

2006-10-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2185] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): add some debug output in
	  the "waiting for release of lock"
	* [r2184] src/winscard.c: SCardDisconnect(): wait for the lock to
	  be released only if it held by someone else (and not just by
	  ourself).
	* [r2183] src/winscard_svc.c: MSGRemoveContext(): do not reset the
	  card if it is locked by by someone else but simulate a card
	  removal instead
	* [r2182] src/readerfactory.c: RFUnlockSharing(): small rewrite

2006-10-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2181] doc/Makefile.am, doc/update-reader.conf.8: add

2006-09-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2180] src/winscard_svc.c: MSGRemoveContext(): Unlock the
	  sharing so we do not get blocked in SCardDisconnect() waiting
	  forever
	* [r2179] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect()/SCardDisconnect(): use a
	  loop of 0.1 second instead of 0.1 millisecond to wait until the
	  sharing is over

2006-09-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2178] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect() & SCardDisconnect(): wait
	  until any transaction finishes before going on. This avoids the
	  possibility to reset a card in the middle of a transaction
	  
	  Thanks to Martin Paljak for the bug report
	* [r2177] src/testpcsc.c: factor the return value test code and add
	  some color

2006-09-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	  SCARD_ATTR_VENDOR_IFD_VERSION...)
	* [r2164] src/error.c: pcsc_stringify_error(): correct a off-by-one
	  buffer overflow. Closes #303836 "pcsc-lite-1.3.2: array subscript
	  out of range"
	  
	  Thanks to David Binderman for the bug report and patch.

2006-09-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2160] src/winscard_clnt.c: change dwContextIndex type from

	  Thanks to -Wextra for the potential bug report
	* [r2159] src/testpcsc.c: correct some variable types to avoid
	  compiler warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
	* [r2158] src/winscard_clnt.c: reformat
	* [r2157] src/pcscdaemon.c: add -H --hotplug argument to ask the

	* [r2149] src/pcscdaemon.c: SVCServiceRunLoop():
	  SHMProcessEventsServer() will not timeout anymore so remove the
	  managenemt code (which did nothing)
	* [r2148] src/winscard_msg_srv.c: SHMProcessEventsServer(): do not

2006-08-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2146] src/winscard_msg.h: struct transmit_struct_extended: use

	  not like 0-sized arrays.
	  
	  Thanks to Iain MacDonnell for the bug report
	* [r2145] src/readerfactory.h: struct ReaderContext: use int32_t

	  Thanks to -Wextra for the bug report
	* [r2144] src/winscard.c: SCardStatus(): do not check for negative

	  Thanks to -Wextra for the bug report
	* [r2143] src/winscard_msg.c: SHMClientSetupSession(): store the

	  Thanks to -Wextra for the bug report
	* [r2142] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): do not test

2006-08-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	  Thanks to Geoff Elgey for the bug report

2006-06-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2080] src/testpcsc.c: revert the last change. It was a

	  LPCTSTR is either LPCSTR or LPCWSTR depending on the value of

	* [r2068] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_EXTENDED
	  to contain up to 64KB of data instead of just 32KB
	* [r2067] src/winscard_svc.c: MSGFunctionDemarshall(): remove two
	  debug messages

2006-05-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2066] TODO: remove "allow the use of extended APDU without
	  breaking libpcsclite ABI" since it is implemented now
	* [r2065] README: do not document --enable-extendedapdu any more
	* [r2064] configure.in: remove --enable-extendedapdu since it is
	  useless now
	* [r2063] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: add support of extended APDU as a new command
	  so we do not need to compile pcsc-lite with or without extended
	  APDU
	* [r2062] src/winscard.c: SCardTransmit(): do not check if
	  cbSendLength or dwRxLength are > MAX_BUFFER_SIZE since this is
	  done by the client already
	* [r2061] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c,
	  src/winscard_msg_srv.c, src/winscard_svc.c: use new
	  SHMMessageReceive/SHMMessageSend API
	* [r2060] src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg.h: SHMMessageSend()
	  and SHMMessageReceive() use "void *buffer, size_t buffer_size"
	  instead of psharedSegmentMsg msgStruct with a fixed size
	* [r2059] src/winscard_msg.h: add SCARD_TRANSMIT_EXTENDED in
	  pcsc_msg_commands and transmit_struct_extended structure
	* [r2058] src/winscard_msg.h: PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR changed from 0

	  if pcscd receives an unknown command
	* [r2054] src/debug.c: log_init(): remove a "pouet" printf() debug
	  message

2006-05-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2053] src/Makefile.am: move the .h file in the *_SOURCES
	  targets so that "make ctags" include them

2006-05-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2052] src/README_INTERNALS.txt: correct typos
	* [r2051] src/README_INTERNALS.txt: update the list of source
	  filesfor pcscd and libpcsclite.la

2006-05-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2050] src/debuglog.c: log_xxd(): replace strlen(c) by 3 since
	  the string length is constant (gain a few CPU cycles)
	* [r2049] src/debuglog.c: log_xxd(): if the buffer is too small
	  then end it with "..."

2006-05-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2042] src/debug.c, src/debuglog.c: improve the @brief comment
	  to differentiate between debug for pcsclite and debug for pcscd

2006-05-09  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2040] src/readerfactory.c: RFInitializeReader(): display the
	  name of the driver used in addition to the name of the reader

2006-05-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2030] src/strlcat.c, src/strlcpy.3, src/strlcpy.c: update to
	  the latest version available from OpenBSD (2005/08/06)
	* [r2029] src/eventhandler.c: EHInitializeEventStructures(): check
	  against MAP_FAILED instead of 0 for the returned value of
	  SYS_MemoryMap().
	  
	  Thanks to Davide Rizzo for the bug report and patch
	* [r2028] src/sys_generic.h: #include <sys/mman.h> so that
	  MAP_FAILED is defined (value returned by SYS_MemoryMap() in case
	  of error)
	* [r2027] src/sys_unix.c: SYS_MemoryMap(): document in Doxygen that
	  the function returns MAP_FAILED in case of error

2006-04-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2025] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.3.1
	* [r2024] src/readerfactory.c: RFLoadReader(): change the way
	  DYN_GetAddress() is used to have a simpler code and avoid a
	  warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break
	  strict-aliasing rules

2006-04-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2018] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: do not use EXTERNAL to export the
	  symbols (revert the previous patch)

2006-04-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2015] README: Add a comment regarding the use of
	  LDFLAGS="-lpthread"

2006-04-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r2010] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex, src/parser.h: do not export
	  LTPBundleFindValueWithKey() to the drivers anymore
	* [r2009] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: tag the functions of the API as
	  EXTERNAL. This can be used to export only those symbols from the
	  driver library.
	* [r2008] src/misc.h: EXTERNAL is a synonym for PCSC_API but more
	  anonymous

2006-04-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1998] src/winscard_svc.c: CreateContextThread(): do not use a
	  pointer to the argument but the argument itself to avoid using
	  the same value for two consecutive threads
	  
	  Thanks to Fabien Merlet for the bug report. See
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q2/0038.html

2006-03-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1991] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: use \texttt{} instead of \file{}
	  (it works with latex2html but not with pdflatex)
	* [r1990] src/misc.h: use __misc_h__ instead of __local_h__ since
	  the file name is misc.h
	* [r1989] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: log_msg: document that you should
	  use the macros defined in <debuglog.h>

2006-03-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1988] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: log_msg and log_xxd are only available
	  for pcscd drivers. These functions are no more provided by
	  libpcsclite

2006-03-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1980] configure.in: use use_libusb="${use_libusb-yes}" so that
	  use_libusb is defined to yes only if it was not previously
	  defined
	  
	  libusb is not used by default on Mac OS X and use_libusb=no is
	  already used in that case a few lines above in the script
	* [r1979] src/hotplug_macosx.c: compile only on Apple and if libusb
	  is not used
	* [r1978] src/Makefile.am: add $(LIBUSB_CFLAGS) to pcscd_CFLAGS
	* [r1975] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: SCardConnect(): the paramater name is
	  dwShareMode instead of dwScope

2006-03-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1970] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPAddHotPluggable(): add the USB
	  serial number only if ADD_SERIAL_NUMBER is defined (default).
	  just #undef the macro if you do not like the serial number
	  addition.

2006-03-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1964] src/Makefile.am: add -DLIBPCSCLITE to
	  libpcsclite_la_CFLAGS (used in debug.c)
	* [r1963] src/Makefile.am: add debug.c to libpcsclite_la_SOURCES
	* [r1962] src/debug.c: provice log_msg() and log_xxd()
	  implementation for the client side
	* [r1961] src/debug.h: use log_msg() instead of fprintf() for
	  Logx() macro used in libpcsclite so we can manage priority and
	  color
	* [r1960] src/tokenparser.l: use debug.h instead of debuglog.h
	* [r1959] src/Makefile.am: do not use libpcsclite-core anymore
	  since the same source code generates two different object files
	  (depending on the presence of -DPCSCD)
	* [r1958] src/winscard_clnt.c: do not use MUSCLECARD_DEBUG
	  environment variable anymore to activate the logs
	* [r1957] src/dyn_hpux.c, src/dyn_macosx.c, src/dyn_unix.c,
	  src/dyn_win32.c, src/sys_unix.c, src/winscard_msg.c,
	  src/winscard_scf.c: #include "debug.h" instead of "debuglog.h" to
	  use fprintf() or syslog() depending if the file is used for pcscd
	  (if PCSCD is defined) or for libpcsclite
	* [r1956] src/debug.h: define Logx() functions for use in
	  libpcsclite (just a fprintf(stderr, ...))
	* [r1955] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: do not declare
	  pcsc_stringify_error() here since it is already declared in
	  PCSC/pcsclite.h
	* [r1954] src/readerfactory.c: do not use pcsc_stringify_error()
	  since I don't want this code in the daemon just for _one_
	  function
	* [r1953] src/debuglog.c, src/error.c: move pcsc_stringify_error()
	  in its own file
	* [r1952] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: remove duplicate Log3() definition

2006-03-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1948] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: document log_msg and log_xxd
	* [r1947] doc/pcsc-lite.bib, doc/pcsc-lite.tex: document VERIFY_PIN
	  and MODIFY_PIN commands using PCSCv2 part 10 instead of the
	  "proprietary" mechanism now unsupported
	* [r1946] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: upgrade sample code for
	  IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE

2006-03-17  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1937] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: add IFD_NOT_SUPPORTED in the
	  possible return values for IFDHSetProtocolParameters()
	* [r1936] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: document the possible values for
	  Protocol argument in IFDHSetProtocolParameters()
	  
	  Closes bug [ #303238 ] IFDHSetProtocolParameters is called with
	  Protocol=1 even though debug log says T=0

2006-03-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1935] src/misc.h: do not use #define INTERNAL __hidden on
	  Solaris since the linker can't use symbol declared __hidden in
	  the file it is declared.
	  
	  See
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q1/0144.html
	  Thanks to Iain MacDonnell for the bug report

2006-03-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1933] configure.in: document --disable-libusb instead of
	  --enable-libusb since libusb is used by default.
	  
	  Thanks to Shawn Willden for the bug report

2006-03-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1931] configure.in: Add support of Solaris

2006-03-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1929] README: remove documentation on
	  --enable-muscledropdir=DIR since this option moved to
	  libmusclecard now
	  
	  Thanks to Ville Skyttä for the patch
	* [r1928] configure.in: remove a useless AC_SUBST(muscledropdir)

2006-03-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1906] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.3.0

2006-02-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1902] README: the correct path is /usr/local/lib instead of
	  /usr/local/pcsc/lib
	* [r1894] Makefile.am: ChangeLog.svn rule: search and replace
	  David Corcoran before corcoran
	* [r1893] Makefile.am: remove libmusclecard directory
	* [r1892] configure.in: remove libmusclecard code
	* [r1885] libmusclecard: move PCSC/libmusclecard in its own package

2006-02-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1884] src/testpcsc.c: add a call to SCardTransmit()

2006-02-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1882] src/winscard_clnt.c: automatically call SCardUnload()
	  when the libpcsclite library is unloaded
	  
	  Thanks to Najam Siddiqui. See
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q1/0177.html
	* [r1881] src/winscard.c: SCardTransmit(): use 0x%08lX instead of
	  %ld since the return codes are defined in hex in PCSC/pcsclite.h

2006-02-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1880] configure.in: correctly detect the use of --enable-libusb
	  (--enable-libusb has the same effect as --disable-libusb)
	  
	  Thanks to Iain MacDonnell for the bug report

2006-02-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1879] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardReleaseContext(): do not check
	  that the thread releasing the context is the one that established
	  it. This check is not performed on Windows and creates
	  portability problems
	  
	  See
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q1/0134.html
	* [r1878] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c, src/misc.h: We can't use
	  a # inside a #define so it is not possible to use #define
	  CONSTRUCTOR_DECLARATION(x) #pragma init (x)
	  
	  The #pragma is used directly where needed
	* [r1877] README: update the available ./configure options
	  
	  Thanks to Shawn Willden for the bug report

2006-02-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1871] Makefile.am: correct the Perl regexp in ChangeLog.svn
	  rule
	* [r1868] Makefile.am: add subversion revision in ChangeLog.svn

2006-02-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1852] src/Makefile.am: remove $(LIBUSB_LIBS) from
	  libpcsclite_la_LIBADD
	* [r1851] ChangeLog, configure.in: release 1.2.9-beta10
	* [r1850] Makefile.am: use ChangeLog.svn instead of ChangeLog.cvs

2006-01-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1849] src/hotplug_libusb.c: if the USB reader defines a serial
	  number then include it in the reader name (between parenthesis)
	  
	  Thanks to Achraf Karray for the patch

2006-01-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1848] libmusclecard/src/Makefile.am: use libmusclecard.la
	  instead of $(top_builddir)/libmusclecard/src/libmusclecard.la so
	  that "make -j2" works. Closes bug "[ #302971 ] 'make -j2' fails"
	* [r1847] src/Makefile.am: add $(LIBUSB_CFLAGS) and $(LIBUSB_LIBS)
	  where needed
	* [r1844] configure.in: use xyes instead of xtrue in x$use_libusb
	  test
	* [r1843] configure.in: reuse libusb detection code from my CCID
	  driver

2006-01-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1838] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c: MSCEstablishConnection():
	  avoids a segfault
	  
	  Thanks to Shawn Willden for the patch
	  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q1/0057.html
	* [r1837] libmusclecard/src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: use
	  $(SYMBOL_VISIBILITY) instead of -fvisibility=hidden
	* [r1836] configure.in: check if the compiler supports
	  -fvisibility=hidden and define SYMBOL_VISIBILITY accordingly
	  
	  Only GCC 4.0 support it AFAIK
	* [r1835] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: #define PCSC_API as no-op if not
	  already defined (needed when included by a driver)

2006-01-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1830] libmusclecard/src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: Compile
	  with -fvisibility=hidden to hide all symbols by default. The
	  export of symbol must now be explicit. That only works for the
	  ELF format.
	* [r1829] src/readerfactory.c: #include "misc.h to get the
	  definition of PCSC_API
	* [r1828] src/winscard_clnt.c: export variables g_rgSCardT0Pci,
	  g_rgSCardT1Pci and g_rgSCardRawPci
	* [r1827] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c,
	  libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c, src/atrhandler.c,
	  src/configfile.l, src/debuglog.c, src/dyn_macosx.c,
	  src/dyn_unix.c, src/eventhandler.c, src/hotplug_libusb.c,
	  src/hotplug_linux.c, src/hotplug_macosx.c, src/ifdwrapper.c,
	  src/pcscdaemon.c, src/powermgt_macosx.c, src/prothandler.c,
	  src/sys_unix.c, src/thread_generic.h, src/tokenparser.l,
	  src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c: #include "misc.h to
	  get the definition of PCSC_API
	* [r1826] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: declare log_msg(), log_xxd(),
	  DebugLogSetLevel() and pcsc_stringify_error() as exported symbols
	  since they are used by libmusclecard or some applications
	* [r1825] src/PCSC/winscard.h: declare the symbols as exported
	  using PCSC_API macro
	* [r1824] src/parser.h: declare LTPBundleFindValueWithKey as an
	  exported symbol (used by the pcscd drivers)
	* [r1823] src/misc.h: define PCSC_API as a way to export a symbol
	* [r1822] src/misc.h: use __GNUC__ instead of __GCC__
	  
	  see
	  http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3.5/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html
	* [r1821] win32/PCSC.h: reformat comment

2006-01-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1817] src/winscard_clnt.c: add speed profiling code
	* [r1816] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardTransmit(): code simplification
	* [r1813] src/Makefile.am: explicitely add $(PTHREAD_CFLAGS)
	  $(PTHREAD_LIBS) to libpcsclite_la_LIBADD and pcscd_LDADD
	* [r1812] src/Makefile.am: use $(FOO) instead of @FOO@ to not
	  replace the values but the variables
	* [r1811] configure.in: do not globaly add $PTHREAD_* to LIBS and
	  CFLAGS

2006-01-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1786] src/hotplug_generic.c: Add missing ReCheckSerialReaders
	  and HPReCheckSerialReaders() so pcsc-lite can compile on FreeBSD
	  and others

2005-12-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1783] TODO: allow to have pcscd and libpcsclite on two
	  different machines.

2005-12-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1781] configure.in: use $prefix/pcsc/services instead of
	  $prefix/services when --prefix= is used but
	  --enable-muscledropdir= is not. Same code as for
	  --enable-usbdropdir=

2005-12-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1777] src/winscard.c: remove a duplicated comment line

2005-11-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1772] TODO: typo corrected

2005-11-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1757] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta9

2005-11-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1756] libmusclecard/src/Makefile.am: libmusclecard needs
	  tokenparser.l but I do not want to provide it through libpcsclite
	  so libmusclecard uses it directly

2005-11-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1753] configure.in: version 1.2.9-beta9
	* [r1748] src/PCSC/reader.h.in: Apple gcc does not support #pragma
	  pack(push, 1) but only #pragma pack(1)
	  powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.0 (GCC) 4.0.0 20041026 (Apple
	  Computer, Inc. build 4061)
	* [r1744] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): do not print an error
	  ""Active Protocol: unknown 0" when we are connecting in direct
	  mode. The card is not supposed to be used at this time.
	* [r1741] src/PCSC/reader.h.in: use uint8_t instead of int8_t since
	  the fields are defined as BYTE, USHORT and ULONG in PC/SC v2 part
	  10 specification
	  
	  This avoids a "warning: overflow in implicit constant conversion"
	  when using values bigger than 127
	* [r1736] src/Makefile.am: tokenparser.l is used by pcscd only and
	  not by libpcsclite
	* [r1732] configure.in, src/Makefile.am: we need to provide
	  LTPBundleFindValueWithKey for all plateforms. This function is
	  NOT provided by Mac OS X. The bug I wanted to correct yesterday
	  is in the CCID driver instead. patch reverted.
	* [r1731] doc/doxygen.css: do not use smaller fonts for functions
	  names so it looks nice with Safari

2005-11-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1728] configure.in: replace dnl by # for comments
	* [r1727] configure.in, src/Makefile.am: we need tokenparser.l
	  (LTPBundleFindValueWithKey) only on non Mac OS X plateforms. So
	  we avoid linking with tokenparser.o and a possible "multiple
	  definitions of symbol _LTPBundleFindValueWithKey" ldd error
	* [r1726] src/hotplug_macosx.c: HPSearchHotPluggables(): fill a
	  "usb:%04x/%04x" string as deviceName[] so it is possible to
	  differentiate two non-identical readers
	* [r1725] src/powermgt_macosx.c: PMRegisterForPowerEvents(): use
	  (PCSCLITE_THREAD_FUNCTION( )) instead of (LPVOID) to cast the
	  function pointer passed to SYS_ThreadCreate()
	* [r1724] src/powermgt_macosx.c: PMRegisterForPowerEvents(): use
	  THREAD_ATTR_DEFAULT instead of NULL in SYS_ThreadCreate()
	* [r1723] src/powermgt_macosx.c: PMPowerRegistrationThread(): use 0
	  instead of NULL since IORegisterForSystemPower() returns a number
	  and not a pointer
	* [r1722] src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_scf.c: use NULL instead of 0 for pointers
	* [r1721] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): initialize the
	  pdwMutex field of a new reader. The bug resulted in a crash on
	  pcscd exit on Mac OS X
	* [r1720] src/debuglog.c: DebugLogSetLogType(): add support for
	  "xterm-color" used by Mac OS X Terminal

2005-11-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1719] Makefile.am: remove "PCSC/" from filenames in the
	  generated ChangeLog.cvs
	* [r1718] configure.in: do not use `pkg-config libpcsclite
	  --variable=libdir` since we _are_ installing libpcsclite. This
	  code was ok when libmusclecard was separate from libpcsclite.

2005-10-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1698] doc/Makefile.am, doc/doxygen.css: use a customized CSS
	  file for Doxygen
	* [r1697] doc/Makefile.am: add a rule to generate Doxygen
	  documentation
	* [r1696] configure.in, doc/Makefile.am, doc/doxygen.conf.in: add
	  doc/doxygen.conf.in and generation of doxygen.conf
	* [r1695] src/tokenparser.l, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_msg_srv.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: correct some Doxygen warnings
	* [r1694] TODO: todo list

2005-10-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1693] src/sys_unix.c: SYS_Daemon(): manually detatch from
	  terminal on Solaris in case daemon(3) does not exist

2005-10-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1690] configure.in: do not try to find yywrap() since we use
	  %option noyywrap now
	  
	  pcsc-lite can now be compiled without (f)lex installed.
	* [r1689] src/Makefile.am: do not link pcscd with @LIBFL@
	* [r1688] src/configfile.l, src/tokenparser.l: use %option noyywrap
	  so we do not use yywrap() and do have to link with flex lib See
	  http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/manual/html_node/flex_17.html
	  
	  Thanks to Toni Andjelkovic for the patch
	* [r1687] src/winscard_scf.c: PCSC_SCF_Initialize(): use

	  thanks to Najam Siddiqui for the patch

2005-10-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1684] src/winscard_scf.c: EventCallback() &
	  PCSC_SCF_Initialize(): Fix issue where SCardGetStatusChange()
	  returns incorrect status when it is called right after
	  SCardEstablishContext() the first time after the libpcsclite.so
	  is loaded in memory, the fix is to make PCSC_Initialize() wait
	  till OCF has been initialized and the internal states are
	  consistent.
	  
	  Thanks to Najam Siddiqui for the patch
	* [r1683] src/winscard_scf.c: add function isActiveContextPresent()
	  missing from my previous commit

	  Thanks to Najam Siddiqui for the patch
	* [r1681] src/winscard_scf.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): Context index
	  was being used instead of Reader index, it worked only when there
	  was just one context.
	  
	  Thanks to Najam Siddiqui for the bug report

2005-09-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1680] src/eventhandler.c: EHStatusHandlerThread(): Solaris 10

	  Thanks to Douglas E. Engert for the patch
	* [r1679] src/prothandler.c: PHSetProtocol(): Solaris 10 IFDhandler

	  supported
	  
	  Thanks to Douglas E. Engert for the patch
	* [r1678] src/eventhandler.c: EHStatusHandlerThread(): log the

	  Thanks to Douglas E. Engert for the patch

2005-09-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1673] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): exists if

2005-09-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1637] src/winscard_clnt.c: use [...].mMutex = NULL; instead of
	  [...].mMutex = 0; since it is a pointer
	* [r1636] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardCancel(): do not synchronise

2005-08-17  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1621] src/PCSC/reader.h.in: Pack the complete structures
	  instead of just the 16-bits fields This syntax is more readable
	* [r1620] src/PCSC/reader.h.in: use __attribute__ ((__packed__))

	  see http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#Link-mode

2005-08-04  Ludovic Rousseau

2005-08-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1599] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPAddHotPluggable(): off by 1
	  buffer overflow. The last character of a string is

	  options.
	  
	  Solaris does not have getopt_long(). Thanks to Heiko Nardmann for
	  the bug report.

2005-06-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1564] src/configfile.l: DBGetReaderList(): *caller_reader_list
	  = NULL by default

2005-06-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1554] src/hotplug_libusb.c: HPRegisterForHotplugEvents(): void
	  function so remove return 0;
	* [r1553] src/winscard.c: SCardTransmit(): initialise
	  sSendPci.Protocol to T=0 by default (avoids a compiler warning)
	* [r1552] src/readerfactory.c: #include "configfile.h" to define
	  DBGetReaderList()
	* [r1551] src/configfile.l: #include "configfile.h" to check the

2005-06-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1549] src/hotplug_linux.c: HPReadBundleValues(): use >= instead
	  of > to check if too many readers are declared in the previous
	  patch
	* [r1548] src/hotplug_linux.c: HPReadBundleValues(): exit early if
	  too many readers are declared since the array to store them is
	  static (PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS)

2005-05-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1544] configure.in: 1.2.9-beta8
	* [r1543] src/hotplug_macosx.c: HPRegisterForHotplugEvents(): use
	  THREAD_ATTR_DEFAULT instead of NULL and
	  (PCSCLITE_THREAD_FUNCTION( )) instead of (LPVOID)
	* [r1542] src/hotplug_macosx.c: replace NULL by 0 in the 4th
	  argument of IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty()

	* [r1538] src/hotplug.h: add HPReCheckSerialReaders()
	* [r1537] src/winscard_msg.h: do not declare
	  SHMProcessCommonChannelRequest() since it is a static function in
	  winscard_msg_srv.c never used elsewhere
	* [r1536] src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c: do not log an
	  error if select() is interrupted because of a manual hotplug
	  signal (SIGUSR1)

	  signal is received
	  
	  This provides a manual serial hotplug
	* [r1534] src/pcscdaemon.c: call RFStartSerialReaders() instead of
	  DBUpdateReaders()
	* [r1533] src/hotplug_libusb.c: implement HPReCheckSerialReaders()
	  to set ReCheckSerialReaders flag if ReCheckSerialReaders flag is
	  set we call RFReCheckReaderConf()
	  
	  This code has nothing to do with libusb or USB but is a serial
	  hotplug so should be in a hotplug loop
	* [r1532] src/readerfactory.c: implement RFStartSerialReaders() to
	  start (serial) readers described in the configuration file
	  (/etc/reader.conf)

	  described in the configuration file. This allows a serial
	  hotplug.
	* [r1531] src/configfile.h, src/configfile.l: rename
	  DBUpdateReaders() in DBGetReaderList() The function now just
	  returns a list of readers described in the configuration file
	  (/etc/reader.conf by default)
	* [r1530] src/readerfactory.h: add struct SerialReader,
	  RFStartSerialReaders() and RFReCheckReaderConf() declarations
	* [r1529] src/winscard.c: remove #include "configfile.h"

2005-05-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1528] src/debuglog.c: DebugLogSetLevel(): do not print anything

	* [r1527] src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c: Do not log a
	  critical or error debug message if pcscd is stopped using Ctrl-C
	  or SIGQUIT Closes Debian bug 306061
	* [r1526] src/Makefile.am: link pcscd with winscard_msg_srv.c
	* [r1525] src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg_srv.c: move the
	  functions only use by the server part from winscard_msg.c to
	  winscard_msg_srv.c
	* [r1524] src/debuglog.c: check if we should use color logs in
	  DebugLogSetLogType() and not only the first time in log_msg()

2005-05-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1519] src/testpcsc.c: #include "reader.h" to use
	  SCARD_CTL_CODE() macro
	* [r1518] src/Makefile.am: distribute PCSC/reader.h
	* [r1517] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in, src/PCSC/reader.h.in: reader.h
	  now contains the #defines shared between the driver and the
	  application
	* [r1516] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: #define SCARD_CTL_CODE(code) and
	  some TeleTrust Class 2 reader tags
	  
	  Thanks to Martin Paljak for the patch
	* [r1515] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardControl(): a 0 byte long
	  pbSendBuffer is no more rejected since the command is in
	  dwControlCode
	  
	  Thanks to Martin Paljak for the patch

2005-05-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1502] src/winscard_clnt.c: add @endcode in

	  makes doxygen crash

2005-05-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1498] src/Makefile.am: do not build pcscd if SCF is used since
	  the library talks directly to ocfserv and pcscd is not used.
	  
	  Thanks to Jeffrey Hutzelman for the patch.
	* [r1497] src/winscard_scf.c: add SCardGetAttrib()/SCardSetAttrib()
	  even if they return SCARD_E_NOT_TRANSACTED for now. testpcsc can

	* [r1462] libmusclecard/src/Makefile.am: use the header and sources
	  files from pcsclite (in $(top_srcdir)/src/)
	* [r1461] libmusclecard/Makefile.am: new file
	* [r1457] src/PCSC/wintypes.h: only use "__attribute__

	  Thanks to Karsten Ohme

2005-04-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1424] src/debuglog.c: use "signed char" instead of "char" for

2005-04-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1423] src/Makefile.am: add misc.h in libpcsclite_la_SOURCES

	  src/strlcpy.c, src/sys_unix.c, src/thread_unix.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.c: define some/most functions as INTERNAL (see

	  This will prevent function names collision with homonym functions
	  defined in a library or program linked with libpcsclite.so
	* [r1418] src/Makefile.am: remove debuglog.c from
	  libpcsclite_core_la_SOURCES so the same source file can be
	  compiled with different -D arguments for libpcsclite_la_SOURCES
	  and pcscd_SOURCES
	* [r1417] src/misc.h: #define INTERNAL

2005-04-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1416] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c: MSCReleaseConnection():

	* [r1412] doc/Makefile.am: DISTCLEANFILES = ifdhandler-3.pdf
	  pcsc-lite.pdf The two PDF files are only removed by "make
	  distclean" so normal users will not have to (re)build them after
	  a "make clean"

2005-03-17  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1403] src/debuglog.c: add colorization of the logs when sent to
	  stderr. The color depends on the priority level: - critical:
	  bright red - error: magenta - info: blue - debug: black
	  
	  A correct implementation should use ncurses to be portable but I
	  don't want to add a dependency on pcscd.
	  
	  The code and idea is greatly inspired from OpenSC.
	* [r1402] src/debuglog.c: change global variable names to use a
	  capital first letter

2005-03-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1389] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta7
	* [r1388] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): revert the previous
	  patch.
	  
	  The wait delay is moved to SCardGetStatusChange()/winscard_clnt.c
	* [r1387] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContextTH(): if
	  MUSCLECARD_DEBUG environment variable is defined we use the more
	  verbose debug level
	* [r1386] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): if the card
	  is present but not yet powered up we give some time to the status
	  thread to do his job

2005-03-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1385] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): give some time to
	  EHStatusHandlerThread() to asynchronously power the card.
	  
	  The problem was that the reader was initialised but the card in
	  the reader was not powered up immediately. So if you are fast
	  enough to call SCardConnect() it would fail with a wrong protocol
	  (since the card ATR is not yet known).
	* [r1384] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect(): use "Attempting Connect
	  to %s using protocol: %d" instead of "Attempting Connect to %s
	  %d"
	* [r1383] src/atrhandler.c: use Logx() instead of debug_msg()
	* [r1382] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: add Log9()
	* [r1381] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: add () after the function name

2005-02-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1380] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: #define Log0()
	* [r1379] src/debuglog.c: typo: "Reader/s" -> "Reader"
	* [r1378] src/winscard.c: SCardControl(): rContext was used before
	  initialisation (segmentation fault)
	* [r1377] src/debuglog.c: DebugLogSetLogType(): do not modify
	  dbgtype argument since it is "const"
	* [r1376] doc/example/Makefile.am: use pcsc_demo_CFLAGS instead of
	  AM_CPPFLAGS
	* [r1375] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: use "%lX" instead of "%X" for
	  rgReaderStates[0].dwEventState field
	* [r1374] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: improve SCardGetStatusChange()
	  documentation
	* [r1373] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: add SCardGetStatusChange() code
	  sample
	* [r1372] src/debuglog.c: update copyright
	* [r1371] src/debuglog.c: simplify the debug output switch
	* [r1370] src/debuglog.c: DebugLogSetLogType(): check the log type
	  argument value
	* [r1369] src/debuglog.c: DebugLogSetLevel(): display the unknown
	  level value
	* [r1366] configure.in: remove --enable-threadsafe since it is now
	  useless
	* [r1365] src/winscard_scf.c: code cleanup
	* [r1364] src/winscard_scf.c: code reindentation
	* [r1363] src/winscard_scf.c: remove #ifdef USE_THREAD_SAFETY since
	  it _must_ be defined for the file to compile
	* [r1362] configure.in: remove --enable-debug since it is not used
	  anymore (log level is no dynamic at execution time)

2005-02-27  Antti Tapaninen

	* [r1357] pbx/config.h, pcsc.pbproj/project.pbxproj: - Upgrade
	  Xcode project related files a bit, compiles yet untested
	  otherwise.

2005-02-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1348] src/winscard.c: SCardControl(): check if the pbSendBuffer
	  is NULL or no bytes are sent for API v2 only. With API v3 we can
	  use dwControlCode as the only data to send.

2005-02-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1347] configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/strlcat.c,
	  src/strlcpy.c: simplify the detection and use of strlcpy and
	  strlcat
	* [r1345] src/PCSC/debuglog.h, src/debuglog.c: remove
	  DEBUGLOG_STDOUT_DEBUG case since it is never used
	* [r1344] src/debuglog.c: use "const int" instead of "int" for
	  priority
	* [r1340] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: update copyright date
	* [r1339] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: document Log1() instead of
	  DebugLogA() in comments
	* [r1338] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: use "const int" instead of "int" for
	  priority
	* [r1337] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: document log_msg() and log_xxd()

2005-02-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1336] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: add a complete Info.plist
	  configuration file
	* [r1335] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c,
	  libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c: use dynamic debug level: LogX()
	  instead of DebugLogX()
	* [r1334] src/atrhandler.c, src/configfile.l, src/dyn_hpux.c,
	  src/dyn_macosx.c, src/dyn_unix.c, src/dyn_win32.c,

	  src/tokenparser.l, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_svc.c: Use dynamic level logging
	  using LogX() instead of DebugLogX()
	* [r1333] src/pcscdaemon.c: Implement the dynamic level logging
	  
	  The new command line options are: -d, --debug display lower level
	  debug messages --info display info level debug messages (default
	  level) --error display error level debug messages --critical
	  display critical only level debug messages
	* [r1332] src/debuglog.c: implement log with priority level.
	  
	  debug_msg() is still provided for backward object code
	  compatibility
	* [r1331] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: use Log1(priority, fmt) instead of
	  DebugLogA(fmt) to add a priority level so that pcscd log
	  verbosity is dynamic
	  
	  We define DebugLogA(a) as Log1(PCSC_LOG_INFO, a) for backward
	  source code compatibility

2005-01-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1315] Makefile.am, bootstrap, configure.in: move *.m4 files

	  to improve performances.
	  
	  Thanks to Philipp Marek for the patch
	* [r1306] src/PCSC/sys_generic.h, src/sys_unix.c: convert
	  SYS_Random() into SYS_RandomInt() to improve performances.
	  
	  Thanks to Philipp Marek for the patch
	* [r1305] src/winscard_msg.c: WrapSHMWrite(): eliminate a
	  valgrind/memcheck-warning
	  
	  Thanks to Philipp Marek for the patch
	* [r1304] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardEstablishContextTH(): eliminate
	  a valgrind/memcheck-warning
	  
	  Thanks to Philipp Marek for the patch
	* [r1303] src/sys_unix.c: SYS_Random(): improve performances
	  
	  Thanks to Philipp Marek for the patch

2004-12-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1296] src/winscard_clnt.c: CardGetStatusChange(): do not sleep

	  the total sleep time was cReaders * PCSCLITE_STATUS_WAIT
	  
	  Thanks to Oivind H. Danielsen for the three patches
	* [r1295] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): move timeout
	  check after other checks so we do not exit with timeout if the
	  timeout is less than 200 ms (PCSCLITE_STATUS_WAIT)
	* [r1294] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardGetStatusChange(): do not sleep
	  if dwCurrentState = SCARD_STATE_UNAWARE

2004-11-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1293] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: SCardStatus: document that pcbAtrLen
	  will contain the necessary size if it is too small

2004-10-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1291] src/debuglog.c: pcsc_stringify_error(): differentiate the
	  error messages for SCARD_F_INTERNAL_ERROR and
	  SCARD_F_UNKNOWN_ERROR

2004-10-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1274] libmusclecard/doc/Makefile.am,
	  libmusclecard/src/Makefile.am, libmusclecard/utils/Makefile.am,
	  libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/Makefile.am: new build
	  infrastructure. Patch from Toni Andjelkovic
	* [r1273] libmusclecard/src/libmusclecard.pc.in: do not force the
	  libpcsclite version to use since the two packages are now
	  independents
	* [r1272] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c,
	  libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c: use < > instead of " " for the
	  include files provided by pcsc-lite (and already installed in the
	  system)
	* [r1271] libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c: use MSC_ARCH instead of
	  PCSC_ARCH
	* [r1270] libmusclecard, libmusclecard/.cvsignore,

	  ListTokens

2004-09-14  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1239] src/ifdwrapper.c, src/winscard.c: add "Card not
	  transacted" error messages. Thanks to Bruce Barnett for the
	  patch.
	* [r1238] src/tokenparser.l: LTPBundleFindValueWithKey():
	  sizeof(tokenValue) is not what we want since tokenValue is a char
	  * and not a char []
	* [r1237] src/tokenparser.l: use strlcpy and simplify the code
	* [r1236] src/configfile.l: remove PCSC/ from the #include path
	* [r1235] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardListReaders(): simplify the

	  src/readerfactory.c: use strlcpy() instead of strcpy()
	* [r1231] libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c: use strlcpy() insted of
	  strcpy()

2004-09-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1230] src/eventhandler.c: EHDestroyEventHandler(): do not try
	  to stop a not started thread (for a reader that failed
	  initialisation and never started)
	* [r1229] src/readerfactory.c: RFAddReader(): stop if
	  EHSpawnEventHandler() returns an error. This occurs if the
	  initial reader check (IFDStatusICC) fails.

2004-09-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1224] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c: convert
	  MSC_INCORRECT_P1/P2 to the corresponding text error message
	  (instead of "Unknown SW").
	  
	  Thanks to Bruce Barnett for the patch.
	* [r1223] src/debuglog.c: use strlcpy/strlcat instead of
	  strncpy/strncat
	* [r1222] src/Makefile.am: use internal strlcpy.c and strlcat.c if
	  these functions are not provided by the OS

	* [r1217] src/testpcsc.c: add a test for SCardReconnect()
	* [r1216] src/eventhandler.c: EHStatusHandlerThread(): remove
	  comment from call to RFSetReaderEventState(rContext,
	  SCARD_RESET); The comment is present from the initial CVS
	  version. I don't know why is was ever needed.
	  
	  This is needed so that SCardReconnect() works after a card
	  movement. Otherwise SCardReconnect() returns "Card was removed"
	  even if the new card is reseted.
	  
	  Note: the comment was present from the initial CVS version
	  (2002/03/30). I don't know why is was ever needed.

2004-09-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1215] src/winscard.c: SCardConnect()/SCardReconnect(): do not
	  set rContext->readerState->cardProtocol if PHSetProtocol()
	  returns an error.
	  
	  This will avoid having a protocol set to -2
	  (SET_PROTOCOL_PPS_FAILED)
	* [r1214] src/prothandler.c: PHSetProtocol(): add the error code
	  returned by the driver in case of PTS failure in the debug
	  message

2004-09-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1211] configure.in: use $prefix value instead of /usr/local/ in
	  usbdropdir and muscledropdir
	* [r1210] src/testpcsc.c: test SCardGetAttrib() with a NULL pbAttr
	  paraleter
	* [r1209] src/winscard_clnt.c: add support of SCardGetAttrib() with
	  a NULL pbAttr parameter to only get the needed lenth in
	  pcbAttrLen

2004-08-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1207] doc, doc/.cvsignore: ignore ifdhandler-3,
	  ifdhandler-3.bbl and ifdhandler-3.blg
	* [r1206] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: always use @confdir_exp@ instead
	  of #ifndef USE_READER_CONF ...
	* [r1205] configure.in: do not define USE_READER_CONF but expand
	  $confdir in confdir_exp
	* [r1204] configure.in: generate etc/update-reader.conf from
	  etc/update-reader.conf.in
	* [r1203] etc/pcscd.init.in: call update-reader.conf to update
	  /etc/reader.conf before starting the daemon
	* [r1202] etc/Makefile.am: use $(mkinstalldirs) instead of
	  $(mkdir_p)
	* [r1201] etc/Makefile.am: - distribute update-reader.conf - create
	  /etc/reader.conf.d/ during installation
	* [r1200] etc, etc/.cvsignore: ignore update-reader.conf
	* [r1199] etc/update-reader.conf.in: use update-reader.conf to
	  regenerate /etc/reader.conf from files in /etc/reader.conf.d/
	  (thanks to Ville Skytt�)
	* [r1198] src/tokenparser.l: LTPBundleFindValueWithKey(): also
	  print the configuration filename if the key is not found
	* [r1197] src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardStatus(): pdwState and
	  pdwProtocol parameters may be NULL (mimic Windows)

2004-08-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1192] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: add SCARD_STATE_UNPOWERED.
	  
	  This #define is not (yet) used by pcsc-lite but is defined by
	  Windows PC/SC and may be used by Windows applications

2004-08-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1191] src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c: define and use an
	  internal SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY_OLD for backward compatibility for
	  applications compiled with the old SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY definition.
	* [r1190] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: correctly define
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY as (SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0|SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1)

2004-08-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1188] src/ifdwrapper.c: forgot to remove 4 DebugLogA("POUET");

	* [r1178] src/ifdwrapper.c, src/readerfactory.c: use the new
	  psFunctions C union
	* [r1177] src/readerfactory.h: psFunctions field is now a C union
	  with three structures for the 3 API. - each structure has
	  complete functions prototypes - only the needed functions are in
	  each structure (some bytes saved :-)
	* [r1176] src/atrhandler.c: remove #define SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET
	  0x00 since it is already defined in PCSC/pcsclite.h.in. Thanks to
	  Toni Andjelkovic

2004-08-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1175] doc/pcscd.8.in: replace an empty line by @HAVE_RUNPID@ to
	  avoid having two empty lines when --enable-runpid is not used
	* [r1174] etc/Makefile.am: do not distribute pcscd.init since it
	  will be generated from pcscd.init.in
	* [r1173] src/utils/installifd.c: remove a call to free() of a
	  pointer that was not malloc()ed and caused a segmentation fault
	* [r1172] src/utils/installifd.c: define DEVICENAME as /dev/null

	  generated from pcscd.init.in
	* [r1166] m4/as-ac-expand.m4: provides a AC_SUBST-like macro
	  (AS_AC_EXPAND) but using expanded variables. From the autostars
	  project (http://sf.net/projects/autostars/)
	* [r1164] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta6

2004-08-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1136] src/eventhandler.c, src/hotplug_libusb.c,
	  src/hotplug_linux.c: use THREAD_ATTR_DETACHED in
	  SYS_ThreadCreate() to automatically deallocate resources
	  allocated by the thread when the thread exits (because the thread
	  is not joined with SYS_ThreadJoin())
	* [r1135] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: remove useless call to
	  undocumented function SCardUnload()
	* [r1134] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c: use THREAD_ATTR_DEFAULT
	  argument in SYS_ThreadCreate()
	* [r1133] src/winscard_svc.c: CreateContextThread(): use
	  THREAD_ATTR_DETACHED in SYS_ThreadCreate() so that the resources
	  allocated by pcscd are deallocated when the client die.
	  
	  Closes [ #300862 ] Don't create threads as joinable
	* [r1132] src/eventhandler.c, src/hotplug_libusb.c,
	  src/hotplug_linux.c: use THREAD_ATTR_DEFAULT argument in
	  SYS_ThreadCreate()
	* [r1131] src/thread_win32.c: update SYS_ThreadCreate() API but do
	  not modify the code
	* [r1130] src/thread_unix.c: SYS_ThreadCreate(): set the thread
	  state: joinable or detached default is joinable
	* [r1129] src/PCSC/thread_generic.h: the second argument of
	  SYS_ThreadCreate if no more LPVOID pthAttr but int attributes so
	  that attributes can be passed in a portable way.
	  
	  /* thread attributes */ #define THREAD_ATTR_DEFAULT 0 #define
	  THREAD_ATTR_DETACHED 1
	* [r1128] src/testpcsc.c: use "%ld bytes" instead of "%lx" for ATR
	  Size
	* [r1127] src/testpcsc.c: use "T=%ld" instead of "%lx" for Reader
	  Protocol
	* [r1126] src/testpcsc.c: use "0x%.4lx" instead of "%lx" for Reader
	  State
	* [r1125] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: add SCardTransmit() code sample
	* [r1124] src/winscard.c: perform a PPS (PHSetProtocol()) only if
	  the current protocol is SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET otherwise only check
	  that the requested protocol is available.
	  
	  This will avoid generating a PPS request that would not be just
	  after a power up. The previous code worked only when the card was
	  reseted at SCardDisconnect() but not when SCARD_LEAVE_CARD was
	  used.
	* [r1123] src/winscard.c: ...->cardProtocol = SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET;
	  after a power up so that the next SCardConnect() with perform a
	  PPS with the desired protocol
	* [r1122] src/winscard.c: ...->cardProtocol = SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET;
	  after a power up so that the next SCardConnect() with perform a
	  PPS with the desired protocol
	* [r1121] src/winscard.c: set ..->cardProtocol = SCARD_PROTOCOL_RAW
	  instead of -1
	* [r1120] src/eventhandler.c: ...->cardProtocol =
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET; after a power up so that the next
	  SCardConnect() with perform a PPS with the desired protocol
	* [r1119] src/eventhandler.c: use ..->cardProtocol =
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET instead of ..->cardProtocol = 0
	* [r1118] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: #define SCARD_PROTOCOL_UNSET
	  0x0000 /* protocol not set */

2004-08-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1117] src/configfile.l: if the file referenced by DEVICENAME
	  can't be use (because it is not a correct filename) we now
	  display: You should use 'DEVICENAME /dev/null' if your driver
	  does not use this field
	* [r1116] src/readerfactory.c: initialise dwSlot field for the new
	  reader slot
	* [r1115] src/readerfactory.c: initialise the lpcDevice field of
	  the new slot and not of the main reader
	* [r1114] src/readerfactory.c: typo in comment (empty spot -> empty
	  slot)

2004-07-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1113] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c,
	  libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c: replace #ifdef MSC_DEBUG by
	  #ifndef NO_MSC_DEBUG
	* [r1112] configure.in: define NO_PCSC_DEBUG and NO_MSC_DEBUG if
	  debug is set to NO instead of defining PCSC_DEBUG and MSC_DEBUG
	  when debug is selected. The debug messages are now displayed by
	  default.
	* [r1111] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: use NO_PCSC_DEBUG instead of
	  PCSC_DEBUG.
	  
	  The debug messages are now displayed by default (no need to
	  #include "config.h" in PCSC/debuglog.h)

2004-07-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1110] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: typo: verions -> versions
	* [r1109] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: add documentation for
	  IFDHGetCapabilities(..., TAG_IFD_THREAD_SAFE, ...),
	  IFDHGetCapabilities(..., TAG_IFD_SLOT_THREAD_SAFE, ...) and
	  IFDHSetCapabilities(..., TAG_IFD_SLOTNUM, ...)
	* [r1108] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: the function SCardSetTimeout() is
	  deprecated and does nothing

2004-07-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1100] src/testpcsc.c: add a "(don't panic)" after a
	  "Transaction failed." if it is not a critical failure.

2004-07-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1099] src/readerfactory.c: RFBindFunctions(): replace the code
	  replication by macros definition and use (FctMap' fields were
	  renamed for this to be easy)
	* [r1098] src/ifdwrapper.c: use new FctMap' fields names
	* [r1097] src/readerfactory.h: rename some FctMap' fields so the
	  field name is the same as in the function name of V3.0 IFDHandler
	  API

2004-07-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1081] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta5
	* [r1080] configure.in: 1.2.9-beta5

2004-07-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1041] libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c:
	  TPSearchBundlesForAtr(): use "%s/%s" insead of "%s%s" when
	  generating the MuscleCard bundle name on MacOSX

2004-07-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1040] src/PCSC/wintypes.h: add type LPSTR (again) so that "old"
	  drivers and applications can compile but mark it deprecated.
	  
	  See
	  http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1/gcc/Type-Attributes.html
	* [r1039] doc/Makefile.am: 'make clean' also removes the LaTeX
	  temporary files
	* [r1038] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: IFDHGetCapabilities(): document the
	  flags SCARD_ATTR_ATR_STRING and IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_VERIFY_PIN
	* [r1037] src/winscard.c: SCardControl() (new API) can now be used
	  with a IFDHandler v2.0 or v3.0. The previous code was broken and
	  only worked with an IFDHandler v3.0 (crashed with a v2.0).
	* [r1036] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: IFDHControl(): use PUCHAR instead
	  of LPCVOID and LPVOID so the driver can use TxBuffer[x] without
	  needing a cast.
	* [r1035] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: it is now possible to compile a
	  IFDHandler v2.0 with this include file. Just #define IFDHANDLERv2
	  in your source code before #include <ifdhandler.h>
	  
	  By default it is setup for for most recent version of the API
	  (V3.0)
	* [r1034] src/ifdwrapper.c: IFDControl_v2() is supported by
	  IFD_HVERSION_2_0 drivers (not IFD_HVERSION_1_0)
	* [r1033] doc/pcsc-lite.bib: add an entry from pcsc-lite
	  documentation

2004-07-04  Damien Sauveron

	* [r1032] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: IFDHControl(): correct the types of
	  pbSendBuffer and pbRecvBuffer.

2004-07-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r1031] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: IFDHControl(): RxLength is a DWORD
	  not a PDWORD
	* [r1029] configure.in: 1.2.9-beta4
	* [r1028] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta4
	* [r1027] src/libpcsclite.pc.in: add @PTHREAD_CFLAGS@ to Cflags:
	  and @PTHREAD_LIBS@ to Libs: so that the compiler and linker do
	  the "right" thing. Thanks to Ville Skytt� for the patch.
	* [r1026] libmusclecard/src/libmusclecard.pc.in: use "Requires:
	  libpcsclite = @VERSION@" instead of just "-lpcsclite" Thanks to
	  Ville Skytt� for the patch
	* [r1025] src/libpcsclite.pc.in: add /PCSC to includedir instead of
	  Cflags:
	* [r1024] libmusclecard/src/libmusclecard.pc.in: includedir is now
	  @includedir@/PCSC

2004-06-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r983] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta3

2004-06-29  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r982] src/libpcsclite.pc.in: the include directory is now
	  ${includedir}/PCSC.
	  
	  If your application Makefile uses CFLAGS=`pkg-config libpcsclite
	  --cflags` you have nothing to change and the migration of the
	  include files in /usr/include/PCSC/ will be painless.
	* [r981] src/ifdwrapper.c: IFDControl_v2(): if the driver version
	  is != IFD_HVERSION_1_0 we _return_ SCARD_E_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE
	  (not just set the return value)
	  
	  IFDControl(): if the driver version is < IFD_HVERSION_3_0 we
	  _return_ SCARD_E_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE (not just set the return
	  value)
	* [r980] src/winscard.c: SCardReconnect(): if the reset fails it
	  may be either because: - the card is unresponsive
	  (SCARD_W_UNRESPONSIVE_CARD) or - no card is present
	  (SCARD_E_NO_SMARTCARD) and the SCardConnect() was successfull
	  with SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT (no need for a card)
	* [r979] src/winscard.c: in SCardConnect() and SCardReconnect(),
	  returns SCARD_W_UNRESPONSIVE_CARD if PHSetProtocol() fails with
	  SET_PROTOCOL_PPS_FAILED
	* [r978] src/prothandler.h: define the constant
	  SET_PROTOCOL_WRONG_ARGUMENT and SET_PROTOCOL_PPS_FAILED
	* [r977] src/prothandler.c: PHSetProtocol(): returns
	  SET_PROTOCOL_PPS_FAILED if IFDSetPTS() is supported but fails:
	  ISO 7816-3:1997 ch. 7.2 PPS protocol page 14 - If the PPS
	  exchange is unsuccessful, then the interface device shall either
	  reset or reject the card.

2004-06-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r976] src/atrhandler.c: do not #undef ATR_DEBUG since it may be
	  defined in config.h with ./configure --enable-debugatr

2004-06-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r974] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: add definition of
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_T15
	* [r973] src/atrhandler.c: - set SCARD_PROTOCOL_T15 in
	  CardCapabilities.AvailableProtocols if T=15 is defined (not yet
	  used) - in specific mode CardCapabilities.AvailableProtocols
	  shall also be set the the specified protocol

2004-06-22  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r968] src/winscard_clnt.c: remove the hack introduced in version
	  1.28. It is no more needed since the changes in version 1.32 of
	  winscard.c
	* [r967] src/prothandler.c: PHSetProtocol(): only try to use
	  protocols that are available

2004-06-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r963] src/atrhandler.c, src/dyn_hpux.c, src/dyn_unix.c,
	  src/ifdwrapper.c, src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard.c,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c: local variables reorganisations: - remove
	  unused variables - remove useless initialisations - move
	  declaration in the inner block the variable is used

2004-06-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r962] src/winscard.c: rewrite the parts managing the protocol in
	  SCardConnect() and SCardReconnect() to use the new
	  PHSetProtocol() prototype and simplify the code
	* [r961] src/prothandler.c, src/prothandler.h: PHSetProtocol(): -
	  add a ucDefault argument as the default protocol to use -
	  completely redesign the function so that IFDSetPTS() is always
	  called to tell the driver which protocol to use and to initialise
	  its internal state
	* [r960] src/winscard.c: the protocol number in the "Send
	  Protocol:" debug message was wrong
	* [r959] src/eventhandler.c, src/prothandler.c,
	  src/readerfactory.c, src/winscard.c: update the code to use the
	  new READER_CONTEXT structure with the struct pubReaderStatesList
	  *readerState field
	* [r958] src/readerfactory.h: in the structure READER_CONTEXT
	  remove: UCHAR ucAtr[MAX_ATR_SIZE]; DWORD dwAtrLen; DWORD
	  dwProtocol; DWORD dwStatus; DWORD dwPublicID; and replace them by
	  a link to the reader structure: struct pubReaderStatesList
	  *readerState;
	  
	  The fields (ATR, procotol, state) were duplicated in both
	  structures PREADER_STATE and READER_CONTEXT. It was useless and
	  misleading.
	  
	  It was uneasy to change the ATR or the card protocol after the
	  card was powered on. A protocol change may occur if the card
	  supports both T=0 and T=1 and the SCardConnect() does not select
	  the default protocol.
	* [r957] src/ifdwrapper.c, src/ifdwrapper.h: in IFDStatusICC() the
	  argument pdwProtocol was set as: *pdwProtocol =
	  rContext->dwProtocol; and rContext was an input argument.
	  
	  So IFDStatusICC() had _no_ action on pdwProtocol expect make a
	  copy form an IN parameter to an OUT parameter. This was useless
	  and misleading. PDWORD pdwProtocol is now removed.
	* [r956] src/README_INTERNALS.txt: add a chapter "Memory
	  structures"

2004-06-17  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r955] src/eventhandler.h: put back the structure name
	* [r954] src/pcscdaemon.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h: do not use a dwAllocNum argument in
	  RFAllocateReaderSpace() since the number of contexts is _fixed_
	  by the declaration of sReadersContexts[].
	  
	  It may be interpreted as a (false) possibility of dynamicity and
	  will then cause a buffer overflow if dwAllocNum >
	  PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS
	* [r953] src/ifdwrapper.c, src/readerfactory.c: psFunctions.pvf*
	  fields are function pointers so NULL is more appropriate than 0
	* [r952] src/readerfactory.c: correct a bug introduced in version
	  1.47 that occurs if a reader is muti-slot and no more
	  sReadersContexts[] entries are available: RFRemoveReader() was
	  called with a NULL lpcReader
	* [r951] src/readerfactory.c: move declaration of dwContextB in the
	  block it is used
	* [r950] src/readerfactory.c: move the lpcStripReader[] declaration
	  in the block it is used.
	* [r949] src/eventhandler.c, src/eventhandler.h,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_scf.c: rename the structure
	  READER_STATES in READER_STATE (singular) since the structure
	  stores only the state of ONE reader
	* [r948] src/PCSC/sys_generic.h, src/PCSC/thread_generic.h,
	  src/eventhandler.c, src/eventhandler.h, src/hotplug_libusb.c,
	  src/hotplug_linux.c, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/powermgt_generic.c,
	  src/powermgt_generic.h, src/sys_unix.c, src/thread_unix.c,
	  src/tokenparser.l, src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_scf.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c, src/winscard_svc.h: correct foobar();
	  prototypes in foobar(void);
	* [r947] src/readerfactory.c, src/readerfactory.h: complete the
	  prototypes of RFSuspendAllReaders() and RFAwakeAllReaders()
	* [r946] src/readerfactory.h: psCapabilites and psProtOptions
	  fields are not used in struct ReaderContext so "#if 0" them

2004-06-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r945] src/prothandler.c: PHSetProtocol() correctly return the
	  selected protocol
	* [r944] src/winscard.c: print the Send Protocol in T=? format
	  instead of internal representation value.

2004-06-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r943] src/winscard.c: improve my previous patch: correctly print
	  an unknown Active Protocol if it happens
	* [r942] ., .cvsignore: add ChangeLog.cvs
	* [r941] src/winscard.c: print the "real" active protocol in the
	  format T=? instead of the internal representation of that value
	  (T=0 is coded as 1)

2004-06-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r939] configure.in: 1.2.9-beta3
	* [r938] Makefile.am: ChangeLog.cvs is not a .PHONY target but a
	  real file
	* [r937] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: - add documentation for
	  LTPBundleFindValueWithKey, debug_msg and debug_xxd - ifdhandler.h
	  moved in PCSC/ifdhandler.h

2004-06-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r936] m4/acx_pthread.m4: version 1.9 to add support of GNU Pth
	  (http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/)
	* [r935] src, src/.cvsignore, src/PCSC, src/PCSC/.cvsignore:
	  pcsclite.h moved from src/ to src/PCSC/
	* [r934] libmusclecard/src/PCSC/mscdefines.h,
	  libmusclecard/src/PCSC/musclecard.h, src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in,
	  src/PCSC/winscard.h: simplify: #if defined(__APPLE__) #include
	  <PCSC/wintypes.h> #else #include <wintypes.h> #endif since we now
	  use PCSC/ for all Unix platforms
	* [r933] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: include PCSC/pcsclite.h instead of
	  pcsclite.h
	* [r932] configure.in, src/Makefile.am: src/pcsclite.h moved in
	  src/PCSC/pcsclite.h
	* [r931] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c, libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c,
	  libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c, libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c,
	  libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.h,
	  libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/bundleTool.c, src/atrhandler.c,

	  src/utils/installifd.c, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_scf.c, src/winscard_svc.c: use
	  the new PCSC/ location for header files
	* [r930] src/Makefile.am: install the exported header files in
	  ../include/PCSC/ to avoid name polution in ../include/ also
	  install parser.h
	* [r929] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: use /* */ instead of // for
	  comments
	* [r928] src/readerfactory.c: rework RFSetReaderName() to simply
	  the code and always start with the lowest number available (like
	  in previous pcsc-lite version)

2004-06-09  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r926] src/hotplug_libusb.c: use a dynamic array for available
	  USB drivers: - avoid a buffer overflow (argh!) - allow to use
	  more than 16 drivers/supported readers
	* [r925] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: replace SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY by
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0 | SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1 since SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY is
	  _not_ defined by Microsoft PC/SC and is not equals to
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0 | SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1
	  
	  SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY is deprecated and should not be used!
	* [r924] src/prothandler.c: improve debug messages and comments
	* [r923] src/winscard.c: remove useless ' ' at the end of some
	  lines
	* [r922] src/atrhandler.c: - add support of specific mode by the
	  presence of TA2 (protocol not negociable) - improve debug
	  messages
	* [r921] src/atrhandler.c: code reindentation and remove useless
	  blank and { } lines
	* [r920] src/atrhandler.c: make debug messages work when ATR_DEBUG
	  is set

2004-06-08  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r919] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: add #include <pcsclite.h>

2004-06-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r918] src/thread_unix.c: remove two unused #define
	* [r917] configure.in: a lexer library (lex or flex) is mandatory
	  to parse /etc/reader.conf so exit ./configure if none is found
	* [r916] configure.in, src/Makefile.am: the libpcsclite library
	  does not compile and work without a thread library even with
	  --disable-threadsafe

2004-06-05  Damien Sauveron

	* [r915] src/utils/formaticc.c: Change the names of the types
	  LPCSTR to LPCTSTR and LPSTR to LPTSTR to be compliant with the
	  Microsoft SCard API
	* [r914] src/tokenparser.l: Add the include needed <errno.h>
	* [r913] src/winscard_scf.c: Add a note about 2 unused functions in
	  the SCF part.
	* [r912] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c, doc/pcsc-lite.tex,
	  src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h, src/PCSC/winscard.h, src/PCSC/wintypes.h,
	  src/eventhandler.c, src/ifdwrapper.c, src/readerfactory.c,
	  src/readerfactory.h, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_scf.c: Change the names of the types LPCSTR to
	  LPCTSTR and LPSTR to LPTSTR to be compliant with the Microsoft
	  SCard API
	* [r911] src/winscard_clnt.c: Add the two inline in the
	  declarations to avoid warning

2004-05-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r909] src/tokenparser.l: display the error message (errno) if
	  the bundle file cannot be opened

2004-05-26  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r908] src/winscard_clnt.c: declare internal only function as
	  "static" (and two one-line functions as "inline")
	* [r907] src/PCSC/thread_generic.h, src/eventhandler.c,
	  src/hotplug_libusb.c, src/winscard_svc.c: add a ' ' argument in
	  PCSCLITE_THREAD_FUNCTION( ) so that old gcc (gcc-2.95) does not
	  comply with "macro `PCSCLITE_THREAD_FUNCTION' used without args"
	  any more.
	* [r902] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: add "Some SCardControl commands"
	  section (IFD_EXCHANGE and VERIFY_PIN)
	* [r901] doc/pcsc-lite.bib: add CCID spec reference

2004-05-25  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r899] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: signedness issue detected by gcc
	  -pedantic
	* [r898] src/thread_unix.c: remove useless { } and simplify the
	  code
	* [r897] libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c, src/PCSC/debuglog.h,
	  src/PCSC/thread_generic.h, src/debuglog.c, src/dyn_macosx.c,
	  src/eventhandler.c, src/hotplug_libusb.c, src/hotplug_linux.c,

	  src/thread_unix.c, src/utils/formaticc.c, src/winscard_msg.c,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: recompile using -pedantic and correct lots of
	  cast "problems"

	* [r884] src/configfile.l: - allow ':' in DEVICENAME - use ':' to
	  indicate a non-real device (do not test for its existence as a
	  file). You can use this in something like "net://1.2.3.4/foobar"
	  to indicate a reader on a remote machine like an X11 terminal.

2004-05-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r883] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: for SCardConnect() -
	  dwPreferredProtocols is a bit mask of acceptable protocols -
	  SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT can be used to talk to the reader without a
	  card inserted

2004-05-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r870] doc/example/Makefile.am: do not install pcsc_demo since it
	  is just a sample code for developpers that is not supposed (the
	  code) to do anything useful
	* [r869] ., .cvsignore: ignore autom4te.cache directory
	* [r868] src, src/.cvsignore: ignore pcsclite.h since it is
	  generated from pcsclite.h.in
	* [r867] ChangeLog, DRIVERS, README, SECURITY, doc/formaticc.1,
	  doc/pcsc-lite.tex, doc/pcscd.8.in, doc/reader.conf.5.in,
	  etc/SmartcardServices, etc/StartupParameters.plist,
	  etc/pcscd.startup, src/README_INTERNALS.txt: Typos. thanks to
	  Ville Skytt� for the patches
	* [r866] src/Makefile.am: install ifdhandler.h so drivers can use
	  it for compilation. Patch by Ville Skytt�

2004-05-12  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r865] etc/Makefile.am: remove reader.conf from EXTRA_DIST since
	  it is already in sysconf_DATA
	* [r864] etc/reader.conf.in: comment the configuration lines since
	  they are not valid and will prevent the start of pcscd if they
	  are not modified
	* [r859] configure.in: use the modern form for AC_INIT() instead of
	  the deprecated one.
	* [r858] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: use @VERSION@ for
	  PCSCLITE_VERSION_NUMBER instead of a manual value. Thanks to
	  Damien Sauveron for the idea.
	* [r857] src/utils/Makefile.am: install bundleTool and installifd
	  in ../sbin/ instead of ../bin/

2004-05-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r855] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta2
	* [r854] configure.in, src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: beta2 version
	* [r853] src/Makefile.am: change libmusclecard current version to 1
	  so that old libmusclecard0 and new libmusclecard1 can cohabitate
	  on the same system and will not break existing programs during
	  upgrades.
	  
	  This is because libmusclecard is provided in the same
	  distrib/package as libpcsclite. If we want two libpcsclite to
	  cohabitate we must also ensure that the two libmusclecard can
	  also cohabitate.
	* [r852] doc/Makefile.am: generate local icons for the latex2html
	  generated pages
	* [r851] DRIVERS: add a / at the end of URLs and directory names
	* [r850] src/pcscdaemon.c: print pcsc-lite version number during
	  startup

2004-05-10  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r849] src/Makefile.am: install pcsclite.h instead of
	  pcsclite.h.in
	* [r848] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: add the chapter "Multithreading and
	  contexts"
	* [r847] doc, doc/.cvsignore: ignore ifdhandler-3 temporary files
	* [r846] doc/pcscd.8.in: some rewrite
	* [r845] doc/formaticc.1: caracters -> characters
	* [r844] libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/bundleTool.8.in,
	  libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/bundleTool.c: approprate ->
	  appropriate
	* [r843] ChangeLog, HELP, NEWS, README, configure.in,
	  doc/formaticc.1, doc/pcsc-lite.tex, doc/pcscd.8.in,
	  etc/SmartcardServices, etc/StartupParameters.plist,
	  libmusclecard/src/PCSC/musclecard.h,
	  libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c,
	  libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/bundleTool.8.in, src/debuglog.c,
	  src/utils/formaticc.c: smartcard -> smart card, musclecard ->
	  MuscleCard
	* [r842] doc/Makefile.am: add ifdhandler-3.tex ifdhandler-3.pdf
	* [r841] doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: IFD Handler API in LaTeX format
	* [r839] src/winscard.c: in SCardReconnect(), SCardDisconnect() and
	  SCardEndTransaction() SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD is "Power down the card
	  and reset it (Cold Reset)" so we really power down _and_ then
	  power up the card.

2004-05-07  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r838] configure.in: the comment for --enable-extendedapdu was
	  wrong. The maximum APDU size is 32KB and not 128KB. Thanks to
	  Damien Sauveron.

2004-05-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r834] ChangeLog: release 1.2.9-beta1
	* [r833] configure.in, src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: version 1.2.9-beta1
	* [r832] src/ifdwrapper.c: in IFDControl_v2 and IFDControl test the
	  ifd handler version and possibly return before the critical
	  section (mutex)
	* [r831] src/ifdwrapper.c: in IFDControl_v2() and IFDControl(), do
	  not return between SYS_MutexLock and SYS_MutexUnLock but set rv
	  to the correct value. Otherwise the daemon is dead locked.
	* [r830] src/hotplug_generic.c, src/hotplug_macosx.c: add an empty
	  HPStopHotPluggables() function
	* [r829] libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c: use the local pcsclite.h
	  instead of the (old) one already installed
	  
	  This was problematic for MacOSX since winscard.h wanted to
	  include <PCSC/pcsclite.h> which is the old and incompatible one.
	* [r828] configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: add
	  support of --enable-extendedapdu argument to allow the use of big
	  APDUs (up to 128 KBytes)
	* [r827] src/winscard_msg.c: minor reindentations
	* [r826] src/winscard_svc.c: in SCardSetAttrib() the cbAttrLen is a
	  DWORD and not a LPDWORD so use gsStr->cbAttrLen instead of
	  &gsStr->cbAttrLen. Bad cut-n-paste here!

2004-05-03  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r823] src/readerfactory.c: - rename dwFeeds and dwMutex to
	  pdwFeeds and pdwMutex since they are pointers - add a check to
	  avoid removing an aleady removed driver (closes bug [ #300684 ]
	  pcscd segfaults on 'if (*sContext->dwMutex == 1)')
	* [r822] src/readerfactory.h: rename dwFeeds and dwMutex to
	  pdwFeeds and pdwMutex since they are pointers

2004-04-27  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r821] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: patch from Damien Sauveron to rectify
	  the source code examples.

2004-04-21  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r820] doc/Makefile.am: do not stop if pcsc-lite does not exist
	  and is removed
	* [r819] doc/Makefile.am: distribute pcsc-lite.tex
	* [r818] doc/pcsc-lite.tex: - SCardControl new API - add
	  SCardGetAttrib()/SCardSetAttrib()
	* [r817] libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c, src/dyn_hpux.c,
	  src/dyn_macosx.c, src/dyn_unix.c, src/eventhandler.c,
	  src/pcscdaemon.c, src/powermgt_macosx.c, src/prothandler.c,
	  src/readerfactory.c, src/sys_unix.c, src/winscard.c,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_svc.c:
	  remove the function names from the debug messages
	* [r816] src/PCSC/debuglog.h: add __FUNCTION__ in the debug
	  messages

2004-04-19  Damien Sauveron

	* [r815] src/pcscdaemon.c: Typo in email address.

2004-04-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r814] src/pcscdaemon.c: update copyright date
	* [r813] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: add SCARD_ATTR_* tags for
	  SCardGetAttrib()
	* [r812] src/ifdwrapper.c: RxBuffer argument of IFDControl is
	  LPVOID and not LPCVOID
	* [r811] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: FDHControl() argument lpInBuffer
	  and lpOutBuffer are LPCVOID and LPVOID and not PUCHAR
	* [r810] src/testpcsc.c: add test for SCardSetAttrib()
	* [r809] src/PCSC/winscard.h, src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c,
	  src/winscard_msg.h, src/winscard_svc.c: add support for
	  SCardGetAttrib() and SCardSetAttrib()
	* [r803] src/testpcsc.c: do not ask for reader number if only one
	  reader is present
	* [r802] src/testpcsc.c: remove useless REPEAT_TEST conditional
	  code
	* [r801] src/testpcsc.c: test SCardGetAttrib()
	* [r800] src/ifdwrapper.h: lpOutBuffer argument is LPVOID not
	  LPCVOID in IFDControl

2004-04-16  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r799] src/testpcsc.c: do not SCardReleaseContext() in case of
	  error in SCardControl test
	* [r798] src/PCSC/winscard.h, src/ifdwrapper.c, src/ifdwrapper.h,
	  src/winscard.c, src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.h,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: add support of the new IFDHControl() API
	* [r797] src/testpcsc.c: add a test for SCardControl()
	* [r796] src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h: rename IFDHControl() to
	  IFDHControl_v2() and add a new IFDHControl() with the new API

2004-04-15  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r793] src/ifdwrapper.c: remove implicit/useless { }
	* [r792] src/README_INTERNALS.txt: document the SCardControl
	  migration
	* [r791] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.h,
	  src/winscard_svc.c: pcscd and libpcsclite now exchange a protocol
	  version to know what API to use
	* [r790] src/Makefile.am: change library version to 1:0:0 since the
	  interface changed
	* [r789] doc, doc/.cvsignore: ignore LaTeX temporary files
	* [r788] doc/pcsc-lite.bib: bibliography in BibTeX format
	* [r787] doc/Makefile.am: - generate .pdf from .tex - distribute
	  the generated pcsc-lite.pdf
	* [r786] doc/pcsc-lite-0.8.7.pdf, doc/pcsc-lite.tex: the pcsc-lite
	  pdf documentation is now generated from a LaTeX document

2004-04-14  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r785] src/pcscdaemon.c: document in the help text that
	  '--foreground' imply '--debug stderr'
	* [r784] src/winscard_msg.h: add a dummy field (to replace
	  request_id) in sharedSegmentMsg to have the same structure size
	  as in previous pcsc-lite versions so that a new pcscd can talk to
	  an old libpcsclite and vice-versa.
	* [r783] src/debuglog.c: add a default case in
	  pcsc_stringify_error()

2004-04-13  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r782] src/testpcsc.c: test SCardListReaderGroups()

2004-04-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r767] src/winscard.c: remove the code to map SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD
	  on IFD_RESET. SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD is power down and power up (cold
	  reset) => IFD_POWER_DOWN SCARD_RESET_CARD is just power up (warm
	  reset) => IFD_RESET

2004-04-05  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r765] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: initialize readers to NULL to
	  avoid a "`readers' might be used uninitialized" compilation
	  warning

2004-04-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r761] configure.in, doc/Makefile.am: add support for
	  doc/reader.conf.5
	* [r760] doc/reader.conf.5.in: new manpage
	* [r759] libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/bundleTool.8.in: typos
	* [r758] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: add two missing free()

2004-04-01  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r757] src/hotplug_libusb.c: do not try to restart a USB driver
	  if the first execution fails (because of a bug in the driver or
	  whatever) since the next execution of the driver will, with a
	  great probability, also fail. The user has to unplug/replug the
	  reader to restart the driver. This prevents to fill the system
	  logs with an error message every 1 second.
	* [r756] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: remove a useless occurence of
	  PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS

2004-03-31  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r754] src/readerfactory.c: use sizeof(lpcStripReader) instead of
	  MAX_READERNAME
	* [r753] libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c: also print tokenType field
	  as a number and string
	* [r752] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c: Initialize
	  currentToken->tokenType in MSCListTokens(). Closes "[ #300607 ]
	  MSCListTokens should set tokenType to know state before OR
	  operation"
	* [r751] libmusclecard/src/musclecard.c: replace some 0 bu NULL for
	  pointers
	* [r750] libmusclecard/src/muscletest.c: - replace 0 by NULL -
	  remove some { } for one line blocks
	* [r749] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: recode the readers enumeration to
	  avoid the use of PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS
	* [r748] libmusclecard/src/PCSC/mscdefines.h: use SCARDCONTEXT and
	  SCARDHANDLE instead of MSCLong32
	* [r747] src/PCSC/winscard.h: use SCARDCONTEXT, DWORD,
	  LPSCARDHANDLE, etc. instead of long, unsigned long, long *, etc.
	  to be more Windows PC/SC compliant
	* [r746] src/winscard_clnt.c: remove two "by najam" comments
	* [r745] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: use MAX_ATR_SIZE instead of 33 in
	  the declaration of SCARD_READERSTATE_A
	* [r744] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: proposed patch: define
	  PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS with a deprecated attribute

2004-03-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r743] src/pcscdaemon.c: remove the warning if no
	  /etc/reader.conf is found. It is normal to not have an
	  /etc/reader.conf for USB readers only.
	* [r742] src/configfile.l: print a warning if the LIBPATH contains
	  ".bundle". USB drivers SHOULD NOT be declared in reader.conf
	* [r741] src/configfile.l: add strerror(errno) in the error
	  message.
	* [r740] src/configfile.l: use NULL instead of 0
	* [r739] src/configfile.l: code reindentation
	* [r735] etc, etc/.cvsignore: remove etc/ from filename
	* [r734] ., .cvsignore: remove PCSC/ from filenames
	* [r733] ., .cvsignore: files to ignore by CVS

2004-03-28  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r732] src/readerfactory.c: simplify a bit an hex->decimal
	  conversion
	* [r731] src/readerfactory.c: left shift one bloc of code that was
	  in a isolated { }
	* [r730] src/readerfactory.c: remove { } for one instruction if ()
	  blocs
	* [r729] src/readerfactory.c: use a direct "DWORD
	  dwNumReadersContexts" instead of an indirect "DWORD
	  *dwNumReadersContexts". This will remove bugs like the one at
	  line 90: "if (dwNumReadersContexts != 0)" is not "if
	  (*dwNumReadersContexts != 0)"

2004-03-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r728] libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c: correct atrString[]
	  buffer size. The ATR is in ASCII so it must be MAX_ATR_SIZE*2 +1

2004-03-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r727] src/hotplug_libusb.c: add void argument in
	  HPStopHotPluggables()
	* [r726] src/readerfactory.c: initialize vHandle field to NULL in
	  RFAllocateReaderSpace() (caused a crash under MacOS X)
	* [r725] src/pcscdaemon.c: add the errno text message if specified
	  reader.conf file is not found
	* [r724] src/pcscdaemon.c: use PCSCLITE_READER_CONFIG instead of
	  reader.conf in debug message

2004-03-20  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r721] src/hotplug_linux.c: add support for HPStopHotPluggables()

2004-03-19  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r720] doc, doc/.cvsignore, doc/example, doc/example/.cvsignore,
	  etc, etc/.cvsignore, m4, m4/.cvsignore, src, src/.cvsignore,
	  src/utils, src/utils/.cvsignore, win32, win32/.cvsignore: new
	  files to ignore files not in CVS
	* [r719] src/winscard.c: really reset the card when asked to in
	  SCardReconnect()
	* [r718] src/winscard_clnt.c: This is hack to allow a change of ATR
	  at Reconnect without physically changing the card. This should
	  not happen in real life so should not be problematic and so is
	  active by default (ATR_CHANGE_AT_RECONNECT).
	* [r717] src/winscard_clnt.c: remove duplicated SYS_MutexUnLock()
	  in SCardStatus()

2004-03-18  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r715] src/pcscdaemon.c: call HPStopHotPluggables() before
	  stopping the drivers to avoid a new reader detection/start by
	  hotplug when we want to stop everything
	* [r714] src/hotplug.h, src/hotplug_libusb.c: add
	  HPStopHotPluggables() to exit the hotplug thread
	* [r713] src/pcscdaemon.c: set AraKiri to TRUE instead of 1
	* [r712] doc/example/pcsc_demo.c: - add SCardReconnect() sample
	  code - allow to select the reader number instead of selecting
	  always the first one

2004-03-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r711] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: version 1.2.1

2004-03-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r710] configure.in: version 1.2.1

2004-02-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r705] src/hotplug_libusb.c: use deviceName defined as
	  usb:idVendor/idProduct:libusb:busname:filename in
	  HPAddHotPluggable(). This should avoid wrong USB enumeration when
	  used in IFDHCreateChannelByName()

2004-02-11  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r684] ChangeLog: merge 1.2.0 final branch

2004-02-04  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r675] src/hotplug_linux.c: DIR in --enable-usbdropdir=DIR may
	  not finish by / in (deprecated) hotplug_linux.c

2004-01-24  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r646] etc/reader.conf.in: use "DEVICENAME
	  /dev/ttySx_not_configured" to make it (more) clear it should be
	  configured.
	* [r645] etc/reader.conf.in: reader.conf may also be needed for
	  PCMCIA readers and not olny serial.

2004-01-23  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r644] etc/reader.conf.in: add a note: "This file has to be
	  configured for serial readers only."
	* [r643] src/winscard_clnt.c: check that
	  psContextMap[dwContextIndex].psChannelMap[dwChannelIndex].readerName
	  is non NULL before accessing it in strcmp()

2004-01-22  Antti Tapaninen

	* [r642] src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_svc.c: - Simplify the
	  psContext/psContextMap declarations to fix build conflicts
	  against some operating systems headers.

2004-01-21  David Corcoran

	* [r639] src/debuglog.c: Changed unsigned char * to char * and did
	  some typecasting to get rid of warnings when building in 64bit
	  mode ...

2004-01-21  Damien Sauveron

	  src/configfile.l, src/hotplug_libusb.c, src/ifdwrapper.c,
	  src/ifdwrapper.h, src/readerfactory.c, src/thread_unix.c,
	  src/winscard_clnt.c, src/winscard_msg.c, src/winscard_msg.h,
	  src/winscard_svc.c, src/winscard_svc.h: Update the copyright.
	* [r631] src/pcscdaemon.c: Add my name, my email and the copyright.
	* [r630] src/winscard_clnt.c: Remove the useless PID information
	  field. Also remove the WrapSHMWrite argument related to PID
	  information.
	* [r629] src/winscard_msg.c: Remove an useless information field of
	  the messages sent by the client to the server. Also remove in the
	  prototype of WrapSHMWrite the parameter related to the deleted
	  field.
	* [r628] src/winscard_msg.h: Remove a useless information field of
	  the messages sent by the client to the server. Also remove in the

2004-01-15  David Corcoran

	* [r624] src/utils/sample.in: Changed Co to C(ZERO) instead. The Oh
	  caused big problems with formaticc
	* [r623] src/testpcsc.c: Needed to define dwAtrLen so it would not
	  just pick up garbage for SCardStatus.
	* [r622] src/winscard_clnt.c: In SCardStatus some of the memcopy's
	  and strcpy's were occurring before bounds checking.
	* [r621] src/winscard_clnt.c: Changed error return from
	  SYS_OpenFile of PCSCLITE_PUBSHM_FILE from UNKNOWN to
	  SCARD_E_NO_SERVICE. Sorry for no diffs, I'll put them in next
	  time ...

2004-01-14  Ludovic Rousseau

	  the context
	* [r573] src/pcscdaemon.c: Change the design of pcscdaemon. It gets

	  thread will manage all the requests for this context
	* [r572] src/winscard_clnt.c: Add mutex for each context and remove
	  the global mutex except for some operations
	* [r571] src/PCSC/thread_generic.h, src/thread_unix.c: Add

	  src/libpcsclite.pc.in: add muscledropdir (in libmusclecard) and
	  usbdropdir (in libpcsclite) so we can use `pkg-config libpcsclite
	  --variable=usbdropdir` to find the directory to use. Should be
	  used by drivers and plugins installation. Thanks to Ville Skytt�
	  for the patch.

2003-11-02  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r546] libmusclecard/utils/bundleTool/bundleTool.c: port under

2003-10-30  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r540] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: changed back
	  PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS from 256 to 16. 16 readers is
	  clearly enough for most users. The correct solution is to use a
	  list instead of an array.
	* [r539] src/PCSC/pcsclite.h.in: remove definition of
	  PCSCLITE_MAX_COMSIZE (Maximum arg size) now useless
	* [r538] src/pcscdaemon.c: - send debug to syslog by default - send
	  debug to stderr if --foreground|-f is used (no need to add
	  --debug stderr anymore) - use strcmp() instead of strncmp() in
	  --debug parsing since one argument has a fixed size anyway -
	  define and use TRUE/FALSE constants

	  service since it was not used.

	  src/hotplug.h, src/hotplug_libusb.c, src/hotplug_linux.c,

	* [r511] win32/PCSC.dsp: - Forgot to commit
	* [r510] win32/Makefile.am, win32/win32_pcsclite.h: - Remove
	  win32_pcsclite.h, it's out of sync anyway and the one who wishes
	  to use pcsc-lite under win32 platform in any situation should
	  probably patch src/pcsclite.h and renew win32/config.h.

	  update
	* [r378] Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am, doc/example/Makefile.am,
	  etc/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/utils/Makefile.am: - Polish
	  and unify Makefiles a bit - More work towards working
	  src/Makefile.am
	* [r377] config.h.in, configure.in, etc/Makefile.am,
	  libmusclecard/src/tokenfactory.c, pbx/config.h, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/hotplug_libusb.c, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/winscard_msg.c,
	  win32/win32_config.h: - Remove MSC/PCSC_TARGET_XYZ defines and
	  the massive use of unflexible automake conditionals. The main
	  reason why pcsc-lite requires "too much" work when porting to
	  another OS. Introduced define PCSC_ARCH, which uses 'uname' as an
	  input. Except Darwin->MacOS. - Removed --enable-usb - Preliminary
	  rewrite of src/Makefile.am, doesn't work yet. - Use gcc specific
	  compiler options only if gcc detected.
	* [r376] build/acx_pthread.m4: Merged some changes from OpenSC
	* [r375] src/Makefile.am, src/PCSC/sys_generic.h,
	  src/PCSC/thread_generic.h, src/dyn_bsd.c, src/dyn_unix.c,
	  src/dyn_win32.c, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/sys_hpux.c,
	  src/sys_solaris.c, src/sys_unix.c, src/thread_macosx.c,
	  src/thread_unix.c, src/thread_win32.c: - Removed most of the
	  duplicated code, replaced with the usage of config.h's defines
	  for portability issues: - Merged dyn_{bsd,unix}.c, left as
	  dyn_unix.c - Merged thread_{macosx,unix}.c, left as thread_unix.c
	  - Merged sys_{hpux,solaris,unix}.c, left as sys_unix.c - Removed
	  MSC_ thread API from generic / win32, they're not used.
	  
	  Starting from now, the source tree might be broken for a few
	  hours or even days. Sorry about that.

	* [r357] src/winscard_clnt.c: add SCardUnload() function to free
	  allocated resources. It is mandatory only if you use
	  dlopen/dlclose to often load/unload the library. Otherwise you
	  will exhaust the ressources available and get a crash. Thanks to
	  Guy Moreillon for the patch.

	  argument is "" | "yes" | "YES"
	* [r344] Makefile.am: move ChangeLog.cvs to DISTCLEANFILES to avoid

	  it breaks under OpenBSD and FreeBSD
	* [r172] configure.in: use "test x${usbdropdir} = xfalse" instead
	  of "test x${usbdropdir} == xfalse" since it generates an error
	  under FreeBSD (test: xfalse: unexpected operator). For a strange
	  reason the bug was not detected earlier.

2002-10-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	* [r171] src/Makefile.am: use -rdynamic instead of

	  Enhanced messaging has been added to accomodate newer devices

	  order to used enhanced messaging you must define
	  PCSCLITE_ENHANCED_MESSAGING in the framework(library), the

	  Thanks to Michael Gile <mgile@mac.com> for the patch

2002-04-06  Ludovic Rousseau

	  descriptors are closed and then debug is useless since sent to
	  /dev/null

	  Ctrl-C signal (in SVCServiceRunLoop) at some time when nothing
	  else happens
	* [r29] src/dyn_unix.c: removed dlerror() from if tests since it is
	  not the best way to test for errors
	* [r28] src/dyn_bsd.c: DYN_GetAddress() now correctly handles
	  errors by not using dlerror() to know if an error occured since
	  the error may have occured in a previous call Also removed
	  dlerror() from if tests everywhere else
	* [r27] src/Makefile.am: add many .h files in include_HEADERS so
	  that 'make dist' include all the useful files add muscletest.c in
	  EXTRA_libpcsclite_core_la_SOURCES
